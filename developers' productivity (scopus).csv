This seems to conflict with a second stream of research, which argues that MCSs risk undermining the intrinsic motivation needed for effective performance in such settings. To solve this puzzle, we build on theories of perceived locus of causality and self-construal and develop an integrative model summarized in 15 propositions. To explicate our proposed solution and to show its robustness, we focus on the class of activities we call large-scale collaborative creativity (LSCC) - contexts where individuals face a dual challenge of demonstrating creativity and embracing the formal controls that coordinate their creative activities with others'. We argue that LSCC requires the simultaneous activation of intrinsic and identified forms of motivation, and simultaneously independent and interdependent self-construals. Against some scholarship that argues or assumes that such simultaneous combinations are infeasible, we argue that they can be fostered through appropriate attraction-selection-attrition policies and management control systems design. We also show how our propositions can enrich our understanding of motivation in other settings, where creativity and/or coordination demands are less pressing. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abernethy, M.A., Brownell, P., Management control systems in research and development organizations: The role of accounting, behavior and personnel controls (1997) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 22 (3-4), pp. 233-248; Abernethy, M.A., Brownell, P., The role of budgets in organizations facing strategic change: An exploratory study (1999) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 24, pp. 189-204; Abernethy, M.A., Lillis, A.M., The impact of manufacturing flexibility on management control systems design (1995) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 20 (4), pp. 241-258; Adler, P.S., The "" learning bureaucracy"" New United Motor Manufacturing Incorporated (1993) Research in organizational behavior, pp. 111-194. , JAI Press, Greenwich, CT, B.M.

In the scientific computing context, component models also promote collaboration using independently developed software, thereby allowing particular individuals or groups to focus on the aspects of greatest interest to them. The CCA supports parallel and distributed coputing as well as local high-performance connections between components in a language-independent manner. The design places minimal requirements on components and thus facilitates the integration of existing code into the CCA environment. The CCA model imposes minimal ovehead to minimize the impact on application performance. The focus on high performance distinguishes the CCA from most other component models. The CCA is being applied within an increasing range of disciplines, including cobustion research, global climate simulation, and computational chemistry. © 2006 SAGE Publications.","Climate modeling; Combustion modeling; Component architecture; Parallel computing; Quantum chemistry","Computer architecture; Computer simulation; Distributed computer systems; Mathematical models; Parallel processing systems; Software engineering; Climate modeling; Component architecture; Component models; Distributed computing; High-performance scientific computing; Large-scale scientific simulations; Quantum chemistry; Natural sciences computing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allan, B., Armstrong, R., Lefantzi, S., Ray, J., Walsh, E., Wolfe, P., Ccaffeine - A CCA component framework for parallel computing (2003), http://www.cca-forum.org/ccafe/; Allan, B.A., Armstrong, R.C., Wolfe, A.P., Ray, J., Berholdt, D.E., Kohl, J.A., The CCA core specifcation in a distributed memory SPMD framework (2002) Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, 14 (5), pp. 1-23; Allen, G., Benger, W., Goodale, T., Hege, H., Lanfermann, G., Merzky, A., Radke, T., Shalf, J., The Cactus code: A problem solving environment for the Grid (2000) High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC), pp. 253-260. , IEEE Computer Society; Jython (2003), http://www.jython.org/, Anonymous; AVS kernel overview (2004), http://www.agocg.ac.uk/reports/visual/vissyst/dogbo8.htm, Anonymous; (2003), http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/, Argonne National Laboratory, MPICH homepage; Armstrong, R., Gannon, D., Geist, A., Keahey, K., Kohn, S., McInnes, L., Parker, S., Smolinski, B., Toward a Common Component Architecture for high-performance scientific computing (1999) Proceedings of the The Eighth IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distriuted Computing; Aspect-oriented software development (2004), http://www.aosd.net/, Aspect-Oriented Software Association; Balay, S., Buschelman, K., Gropp, W., Kaushik, D., Knepley, M., McInnes, L., Smith, B.F., Zhang, H., (2003) PETSc Users Manual, , http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc, Technical Report ANL-95/11 - Revision 2.1.5, Argonne National Laboratory; Balay, S., Gropp, W.D., McInnes, L.C., Smith, B.F., Efficient management of parallelism in object oriented numerical software libraries (1997) Modern Software Tools in Scientific Computing, pp. 163-202. , (eds E.

It has suggested that NeuroIS contributes to an improved explanation and prediction of IS phenomena. Yet, such research is unclear on the source of this improvement; while some studies indicate that NeuroIS constitutes an alternative to psychometrics, implying that the two methods assess the same dimension of an underlying IS construct, other studies indicate that NeuroIS constitutes a complement to psychometrics, implying that the two methods assess different dimensions of an IS construct. To clarify the role of NeuroIS in IS research and its contribution to IS research, in this study, we examine whether NeuroIS and psychometrics/psychological methods constitute alternatives or complements. We conduct this examination in the context of technostress, an emerging IS phenomenon to which both methods are relevant. We use the triangulation approach to explore the relationship between physiological and psychological/self-reported data. Using this approach, we argue that both kinds of data tap into different aspects of technostress and that, together, they can yield a more complete or holistic understanding of the impact of technostress on a theoretically-related outcome, rendering them complements. Then, we test this proposition empirically by probing the correlation between a psychological and a physiological measure of technostress in combination with an examination of their incremental validity in explaining performance on a computer-based task. The results show that the physiological stress measure (salivary alpha-amylase) explains and predicts variance in performance on the computer-based task over and above the prediction afforded by the self-reported stress measure. We conclude that NeuroIS is a critical complement to IS research. © 2014, Association for Information Systems.

To address this issue, this research seeks to distinguish time-based software development practices: those managerial actions that result in faster development speed and higher productivity. This study is based upon a survey of software management practices in Western Europe and builds upon an earlier study we carried out in the United States and Japan. We measure the extent to which managers in the United States, Japan, and Europe differ in their management of software projects and also determine the tools, technology, and practices that separate fast and slow developers in Western Europe. ©1996 IEEE.","And the united states; Empirical research; Europe; Global performance comparisons; Japan; Management factors; Software development; Software engineering; Software speed and productivity",,,,,,"Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Vanderbilt University: AFOSR-91-0440","The authors wish to thank the referees for their many helpful comments on our paper.

In the modern world, it is frequently conducted through interactions with search systems. The retrieval and comprehension of information returned by these systems is a key part of decision making and action in a broad range of settings. Advances in data availability coupled with new interaction paradigms, and mobile and cloud computing capabilities, have created a broad range of new opportunities for information access and use. In this comprehensive book for professionals, researchers, and students involved in search system design and evaluation, search expert Ryen White discusses how search systems can capitalize on new capabilities and how next-generation systems must support higher order search activities such as task completion, learning, and decision making. He outlines the implications of these changes for the evolution of search evaluation, as well as challenges that extend beyond search systems in areas such as privacy and societal benefit. Discusses many new technologies and their role in the search process. Covers important issues involving data availability and privacy. Talks about these issues in depth, educating searchers in the benefits and potential costs involved in using big (and small) data. Combines research from information retrieval, information science, and human-computer interaction. © Ryen W. White 2016.

Although considerable research effort has been made in this area, as yet, no agreement has been reached about the impact of these dispersion dimensions on team coordination and project outcomes. Objective: This paper summarizes empirical evidence on the impact of global dispersion dimensions on coordination, team performance and project outcomes. Method: We performed a systematic literature review of 46 publications from 25 journals and 19 conference and workshop proceedings, which were published between 2001 and 2013. Thematic analysis was used to identify global dimensions and their measures. Vote counting was used to decide on the impact trends of dispersion dimensions on team performance and software quality. Results: Global dispersion dimensions are consistently conceptualized, but quantified in many different ways. Different dispersion dimensions are associated with a distinct set of coordination challenges. Overall, geographical dispersion tends to have a negative impact on team performance and software quality. Temporal dispersion tends to have a negative impact on software quality, but its impact on team performance is inconsistent and can be explained by type of performance. Conclusion: For researchers, we reveal several opportunities for future research, such as coordination challenges in inter-organizational software projects, impact of processes and practices mismatches on project outcomes, evolution of coordination needs and mechanism over time and impact of dispersion dimensions on open source project outcomes. For practitioners, they should consider the tradeoff between cost and benefits while dispersing tasks, alignment impact of dispersion dimensions with individual and organizational objectives, coordination mechanisms as situational approaches and collocation of development activities of high quality demand components in GSD projects. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

You must correctly analyze the needs of the customer and match these needs with your resources to not only produce a product and but also deliver it in a timely manner. An in-depth understanding of systematic release planning can put you on this path. Authored by renowned expert Günther Ruhe, Product Release Planning: Methods, Tools and Applications presents methods and tools to apply sound planning to product development and product management. The book covers the different aspects of supporting product release decisions ranging from foundations to methods, tools, and applications. Equal parts art and science, the actual decision-making is described as a process of combining rigorous methods with the intuition and experience of human experts. Ruhe provides a guided tour through the methodology and use of release planning, starting with technology and market needs and proceeding to product planning and finally to development projects. He studies three fundamental classes of problems: prioritization of features, product release planning on a strategic level (roadmapping), and release planning on an operational level (staffing). Presenting and discussing tool support for all the methods covered, the author supplies case studies that underpin the methodologies with practical examples. He also supplies trial accounts (read only) for the two most important decision tools for prioritization and product release planning. The author freely admits that the techniques presented are not supposed to be the ultimate truth, but a direction to go to support human decision-making, to better understand the rational of the decisions made, and to grow in the capability of mastering the whole planning process. © 2010 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Using the same coding method, the 2011 JIT article, 'Business Process Outsourcing Studies: A Critical Review and Research Directions,' analyzed 615 findings on the determinants of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) decisions and outcomes from 67 empirical articles published between 1996 and 2011. Taken together, these two reviews found that the preponderance of evidence from both ITO and BPO research streams produced largely consistent results pertaining to the categories of independent variables that affected outsourcing decisions and outcomes. To investigate the most current research findings on business services, which comprise ITO and BPO, and to compare the results with the prior JIT reviews, we replicated the method used in the prior JIT reviews. In this update, we examined 174 newly published articles across 78 academic journals published between 2010 and 2014. We found that researchers have significantly expanded the variables of interest in the last 4 years. In all, researchers investigated 69 new variables. Compared with earlier research, this review of recent articles found a deeper exploration of the direct effects of transaction attributes, sourcing motivations, client and provider capabilities, and governance on sourcing decisions and outcomes. Researchers have also studied a broader variety of sourcing decisions, including shared services, captive centers, rural sourcing and backsourcing. This update also found a more nuanced understanding of relational governance and its interaction with contractual governance. We assessed the research progress that has been made on ten previously identified gaps in knowledge. We proposed a future research agenda that includes continued, incremental progress on 'normal science' research questions, as well as more ambitious research goals. We challenged researchers to investigate how sourcing clients, providers, and advisors can protect jobs, protect the environment, and ensure security in an increasingly automated world. © 2016 Association for Information Technology Trust.","business services sourcing literature review; IT outsourcing; business process outsourcing; outsourcing","Just in time production; Publishing; Business process outsourcing; Empirical literature; Future research directions; Independent variables; Information technology outsourcing; Literature reviews; Outsourcing decisions; Relational governances; Outsourcing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Indicates the article was coded in this review; (2012) Exploring the Value Proposition from Impact Sourcing: The Buyer's Perspective [Www Document], , http://www.accenture.com/us-en/Pages/insight-exploring-value-proposition-impactsourcing.aspx, Accenture accessed 20 July 2015; Agrawal, S., Goswami, K., Chatterjee, B., Factors Influencing Performance of ITES Firms in India (2012) Information Resources Management Journal, 25 (4), pp. 46-64; Agrawal, P., Haleem, A., The Impact of the Outsourcing of IT on Firm Performance: An empirical study (2013) International Journal of Management, 30 (3), pp. 121-139; Agrawal, P., Hall, S.C., Using Accounting Metrics as Performance Measures to Assess the Impact of Information Technology Outsourcing on Manufacturing and Service Firms (2014) Journal of Applied Business Research, 30 (5), pp. 1559-1568; Agarwal, M., Kishore, R., Rao, H.R., Market Reactions to E-business Outsourcing Announcements: An event study (2006) Information & Management, 43 (7), pp. 861-873; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Ali, S., Green, P., Effective Information Technology (IT) Governance Mechanisms: An IT outsourcing perspective (2012) Information Systems Frontiers, 14 (2), pp. 179-193; Alvarez-Suescun, E., Combining Transaction Cost and Resource-Based Insights to Explain IT Implementation Outsourcing (2010) Information Systems Frontiers, 12 (5), pp. 631-645; Amiruddin, R., Aman, A., Auzair, S.M., Hamzah, N., Maelah, R., Mitigating Risks in a Shared Service Relationship: The case of a Malaysian bank (2013) Qualitative Research in Accounting and Management, 10 (1), pp. 78-93; Andries, P., Thorwarth, S., Should Firms Outsource their Basic Research? the Impact of Firm Size on In House versus Outsourced R&D Productivity (2014) Creativity and Innovation Management, 23 (3), pp. 303-317; Ang, S., Cummings, L., Strategic Response to Institutional Influences on Information Systems Outsourcing (1997) Organization Science, 8 (3), pp. 235-256; Angeli, F., Grimaldi, R., Leveraging Offshoring: The identification of new business opportunities in international settings (2010) Industry and Innovation, 17 (4), pp. 393-413; Argyres, N., Zenger, T., Capabilities, Transaction Costs, and Firm Boundaries (2012) Organization Science, 23 (6), pp. 1643-1657; Arnold, V., Benford, T., Hampton, C., Sutton, S., Competing Pressures of Risk and Absorptive Capacity Potential on Commitment and Information Sharing in Global Supply Chains (2010) European Journal of Information Systems, 19 (2), pp. 134-152; Aubert, B.A., Houde, J.F., Patry, M., Rivard, S., A Multi-Level Investigation of Information Technology Outsourcing (2012) The Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 21 (3), pp. 233-244; Aubert, B., Rivard, S., Templier, M., Information Technology and Distance-Induced Effort to Manage Offshore Activities (2011) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 58 (4), pp. 758-771; (2012) Incentives & Opportunities for Scaling the 'Impact Sourcing' Sector, , https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/app/uploads/Incentives-Opportunities-for-Scaling-the-Impact-Sourcing-Sector.pdf, Avasant/Rockefeller Foundation Corporate report by Avasant consultancy [WWW document] accessed 3 February 2016; Babin, R., Assessing the Role of CSR in Outsourcing Decisions (2008) Journal of Information Systems Applied Research, 1 (2), pp. 1-14; Babin, R., Nicholson, B., Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility in Global IT Outsourcing (2009) MIS Quarterly Executive, 8 (4), pp. 123-132; Babin, R., Nicholson, B., How Green is My Outsourcer?

The results indicated that IS managers were generally more positive about systems development methodologies than were developers. IS managers perceived methodology support for organizational alignment, and methodology impact on the productivity and quality of the development process to be significantly more important than did system developers, who, in turn, perceived methodology support for verification and validation significantly higher than did IS managers. These differences can be explained by the relevance and importance of the support to the task that the stakeholders perform. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Extant studies are conflicting, especially with respect to the importance of the monetary reward as a motivation. Moreover, literature supports our premise from the individuals' motivations analysis viewpoint, but not from the companies' perspective. Finally, literature does not consider the differences related to different members and to different phases of the innovation process. First, we base the literature on open innovation on the Internet (crowdsourcing, peer production and open source) to identify the potential motivations. We then deeply analyse 116 OIPs to determine if the motivations can be a function of the phase of innovation and the dependency on members. We show that the design of the motivational system should take into consideration the different stages of the innovation process and that the OIPs should consider moving from 'work place' logic to 'social place' logic. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.","Crowdsourcing; Motivations; Open innovation; Web-based platforms",,,,,,"243593, FP 7–SME 2008–2; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme managed by REA-Research Executive Agency http://ec.europa.eu/research/rea ([FP 7–SME 2008–2]) under grant agreement no [243593], project COLLECTIVE – Emerging communities for collective innovation: ICT Operational tool and supporting methodologies for SME Associations.

Within this overall goal we also investigate which productivity concept was adopted by the agile teams studied. We here conducted two case studies in the industry and analyzed data from two projects that we followed for six months. From the perspective of agile team members the three most perceived factors impacting on their productivity were appropriate team composition and allocation external dependencies and staff turnover. Teams also mentioned pair programming and collocation as agile practices that impact productivity. As a secondary finding most team members did not share the same understanding of the concept of productivity. While some known factors still impact agile team productivity new factors emerged from the interviews as potential productivity factors impacting agile teams.© 2011 IEEE.","Agile methods; Empirical analysis; Productivity factors; Team productivity","Agile methods; Agile practices; Agile teams; Empirical analysis; Pair-programming; Potential productivity; Productivity factors; Team composition; Team members; Productivity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Boehm, B.W., Improving software productivity (1987) Computer, 20 (9), pp. 43-57; Trendowicz, A., Münch, J., Factors influencing software development productivity - state-of-the-art and industrial experiences (2009) Advances in Computers, 77, pp. 185-241; Vosburgh, J., Curtis, B., Wolverton, R., Albert, B., Malec, H., Hoben, S., Liu, Y., Productivity factors and programming environments (1984) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 143-152. , ser.

Despite the common understanding that developer behavioral interaction patterns can affect software quality, these widely used defect prediction metrics do not consider developer behavior. We therefore propose micro interaction metrics (MIMs), which are metrics that leverage developer interaction information. The developer interactions, such as file editing and browsing events in task sessions, are captured and stored as information by Mylyn, an Eclipse plug-in. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that MIMs significantly improve overall defect prediction accuracy when combined with existing software measures, perform well in a cost-effective manner, and provide intuitive feedback that enables developers to recognize their own inefficient behaviors during software development. © 2016 IEEE.","Defect prediction; developer interaction; Mylyn; software metrics; software quality","Computer software selection and evaluation; Cost effectiveness; Defects; Forecasting; Quality assurance; Defect prediction; developer interaction; Mylyn; Software metrics; Software Quality; Software design",,,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, MEST: 2012M3C4A7033345","This research was supported by Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (2012M3C4A7033345).",,,,,,,,,,"Vahid, F., Givargis, T.D., (2001) Embedded System Design: A Unified Hardware/Software Introduction, , Hoboken NJ USA: Wiley; Hassan, A., Predicting faults using the complexity of code changes (2009) Proc. 31st Int.

Based on this discussion, the author develops a theoretical framework including human agency as an individual feature (i.�e., a disposition) as well as a set of self-initiated and goal-directed behaviours that are assumed to affect employees learning and development (e.g., crafting of new work experiences). He then further specifies this theoretical framework and investigates it empirically in the domain of geriatric care nursing. Based on the findings of the three empirical studies conducted, the author discusses the relevance of human agency for the development of professional expertise of geriatric care nurses. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH 2017.

The approach outlined in this paper first mines frequent IDE usage patterns, filtered via a set of thresholds and by the authors, that are subsequently supported (or disputed) using a developer survey, in order to form usage smells. In contrast with conventional mining of IDE usage data, our approach identifies time-ordered sequences of developer actions that are exhibited by many developers in the field. This pattern mining workflow is resilient to the ample noise present in IDE datasets due to the mix of actions and events that these datasets typically contain. We identify usage patterns and smells that contribute to the understanding of the usability of Visual Studio for debugging, code search, and active file navigation, and, more broadly, to the understanding of developer behavior during these software development activities. Among our findings is the discovery that developers are reluctant to use conditional breakpoints when debugging, due to perceived IDE performance problems as well as due to the lack of error checking in specifying the conditional. © 2017 IEEE.","data mining; IDE usage data; pattern mining; usability analysis","Data mining; Discovery wells; Odors; Program debugging; Software design; Studios; Developer behavior; Development activity; Large-scale dataset; Pattern mining; Performance problems; Time-ordered sequences; Usability analysis; Usage data; Integrodifferential equations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Negara, S., Codoban, M., Dig, D., Johnson, R.E., Mining finegrained code changes to detect unknown change patterns Proc. 36th Int.

Software reuse has been advocated as a means of revolutionizing this process. The claimed benefits from software reuse are reduction in development cost and time, improvement in software quality, increase in programmer productivity, and improvement in maintainability. Software reuse entails undeniable costs of creating, populating, and maintaining a library of reusable components. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that some organizations benefit from reuse. However, many software developers practicing reuse claim these benefits without formal demonstration thereof. There is little research to suggest when the benefits are expected and to what extent they will be realized. For example, does a larger library of reusable components lead to increased savings? What is the impact of component size on the effectiveness of reuse? This research seeks to address some of these questions. It represents the first step in a series wherein the effects of software reuse on overall development effort and costs are modeled with a view to understanding when it is most effective. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, we investigated meetings and the collaboration tool Slack. We conducted a longitudinal case study using a mixed-methods approach with surveys, observations, interviews, and chat logs. Our quantitative results show that employees in global projects spend 7 h 45 min per week on average in scheduled meetings and 8 h 54 min in unscheduled meetings. Furthermore, distributed teams were significantly larger than co-located teams, and people working in distributed teams spent somewhat more time in meetings per day. We found that low availability of key people, absence of organizational support for unscheduled meetings and unbalanced activity from team members in meetings and on Slack were barriers for effective coordination across sites. The positive aspects of using collaboration tools in distributed teams were increased team awareness and informal communication and reduced the need for e-mail. Our study emphasizes the importance of reflecting on how global software engineering teams use meetings and collaboration tools to coordinate. We provide practical advice for conducting better meetings and give suggestions for more efficient use of collaboration tools in global projects. © 2020 The Authors","Agile software development; Collaboration tools; Computer-mediated communication; Distributed teams; Global teamwork; Team communication platforms","Software engineering; Collaboration Tool; Coordination mechanisms; Distributed teams; Global software engineering; Informal communication; Longitudinal case study; Organizational support; Quantitative result; Human resource management",,,,,"Norges Forskningsråd: 267704, 309631","We are grateful to all the participants in the case study.

However, there is very little rigorous research to support this claim. Like most of their predecessors, the development and promotion of these methods has been almost entirely driven by practitioners and consultants, with little objective validation from the research community. This lack of validation is particularly relevant for SMEs, given that many of their project teams typify the environment to which agile methods are most suited i.e. small, co-located teams with diverse, blended skills in unstructured, sometimes even chaotic surroundings. This paper uses creativity theory as a lens to review the current agile method literature to understand exactly how much we know about the extent to which creativity actually occurs in these agile environments. The study reveals many gaps and conflict of opinion in the body of knowledge in its current state and identifies many avenues for further research. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2009.",,"Information systems; Information use; Silicon compounds; Agile environment; Agile methods; Agile systems; Body of knowledge; Literature reviews; Project team; Research communities; Rigorous research; Agile manufacturing systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, T., (1977) Managing the Flow of Technology: Technology Transfer and the Dissemination of Technological Information within the R&D Organization, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Amabile, T., (1996) Creativity in Context, , Westview Press, Boulder; Amabile, T., How to Kill Creativity (1998) Harvard Business Review, 76 (5), pp. 77-87; Anderson, N., West, M., (1996) The Team Climate Inventory Development Exercises, , Windsor, England; Andrews, F., (1979) Scientific Productivity, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Auer, K., Miller, R., (2002) Extreme Programming Applied - Playing to Win, , Addison-Wesley, Reading; Augustine, S., (2005) Managing Agile Projects, , Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River; Bailyn, L., Autonomy in the Industrial R&D Laboratory (1985) Human Resource Management, 24 (1), pp. 129-146; Beck, K., Embracing change with extreme programming (1999) IEEE Computer, 32 (10), pp. 70-77; Beck, K., (1999) Extreme Programming Explained, , Addison Wesley, Reading; Beck, K., Fowler, M., (2001) Planning Extreme Programming, , Addison-Wesley, Boston; Brooks, F., No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering (1987) IEEE Computer, 20 (4), pp. 10-19; Canfora, G., Cimitile, A., Empirical study on the productivity of the pair programming (2005) XP 2005.

Since then, work in the scientific literature has stated that the application of software reuse offers benefits such as increase in quality and productivity. Nonetheless, in spite of many publications reporting software reuse experiences, evidence that such benefits having reached industrial settings is scarce. Objective: To identify and classify the benefits transferred to real-world settings by the application of software reuse strategies. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS). Our search strategies retrieved a set of 2,413 papers out of which 49 were selected as primary studies. We defined five facets to classify these studies: (a) the type of benefit, (b) the reuse process, (c) the industry's domain, (d) the type of reuse and (e) the type of research reported. Results: Quality increase (28 papers) and Productivity increase (25 papers) were the two most mentioned benefits. Component-Based Development (CBD) was the most reported reuse strategy (41%), followed by Software Product Lines (SPL, 30%). The selected papers mentioned fourteen industrial domains, of which four stand out: aerospace and defense, telecommunications, electronics and IT services. The application of systematic reuse was reported in 78% of the papers. Regarding the research type, 50% use evaluation research as the investigation method. Finally, 13 papers (27%) reported validity threats for the research method applied. Conclusions: The literature analyzed presents a lack of empirical data, making it difficult to evaluate the effective transfer of benefits to the industry. This work did not find any relationship between the reported benefits and the reuse strategy applied by the industry or the industry domain. Although the most reported research method was industrial case studies (25 works), half of these works (12) did not report threats to validity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Evidence-based software engineering; Industry; Real-world setting; Software reuse; Software reuse benefits; Software reuse processes; Systematic mapping study; Systematic review","Application programs; Industrial research; Industry; Mapping; Paper; Productivity; Component-Based Development; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Investigation methods; Productivity increase; Real world setting; Scientific literature; Systematic mapping studies; Systematic Review; Computer software reusability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tracz, W., COTS myths and other lessons learned in component-based software development (2001) Component-Based Software Engineering: Putting the Pieces Together, pp. 99-111. , G.T.H.

Using the example of corporate OSS engagement, Oliver Alexy shows how this practice can be carried out both effectively and efficiently by companies. He evaluates potential advantages and disadvantages from the viewpoint of top management and company employees to understand how this practice diffuses within the corporation, and who is likely to support it. Simultaneously, the author demonstrates how corporate processes can be designed to increase the odds of success of free revealing. © Gabler | GWV Fachverlage GmbH, Wiesbaden 2009.

These evolutionary couplings are expressed at the file and method levels of granularity, and are applied to support the tasks of commit and interaction predictions. Although the topic of mining evolutionary couplings has been investigated previously, the empirical comparison and combination of the two types from interaction and commit histories have not been attempted. An empirical study on 3272 interactions and 5093 commits from Mylyn, an open source task management tool, was conducted. These interactions and commits were divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the combined, and individual, models. Precision and recall metrics were used to measure the performance of these models. The results show that combined models offer statistically significant increases in recall over the individual models for change predictions. At the file level, the combined models achieved a maximum recall improvement of 13% for commit prediction with a 2% maximum precision drop. © 2013 IEEE.","Commit History; Evolutionary Couplings; Interaction History;

Strategic Software Engineering: An Interdisciplinary Approach presents software engineering as a strategic, business-oriented, interdisciplinary endeavor, rather than simply a technical process, as it has been described in previous publications. The book addresses technical, scientific, and management aspects of software development in a way that is accessible to a wide audience. It provides a detailed, critical review of software development models and processes, followed with a strategic assessment of how process models evolved over time and how to improve them. The authors then focus on the relation between problem-solving techniques and strategies for effectively confronting real-world business problems. They also analyze the impact of interdisciplinary factors on software development, including the role of people and business economics. The book concludes with a brief look at specialized system development. The diverse backgrounds of the authors, encompassing computer science, information systems, technology, and business management, help create this book's integrated approach, which answers the demand for a comprehensive, interdisciplinary outlook encompassing all facets of how software relates to an organization. © 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Information management; Problem solving; Business economics; Business management; Integrated approach; Interdisciplinary endeavor; Problem solving technique; Software development models; Specialized systems; Strategic assessment; Software design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdel-Hamid, T., Madnick, S.E., Lessons lear ned from modeling the dynamics of software development (1989) Commun.

It is important to investigate intervening factors that challenge software development productivity. In this paper, the authors mixed method approach harnesses a structural equation model (SEM) for its quantitative part to establish a paradigm for understanding the effects of social factors for software development organizations. The proposed SEM model measures the correlations between several potential factors associatedwith productivity, social productivity, and social capital that are chosen as latent variables. For the qualitative phase, an industrial focus group is used to single out these factors and their association with potential social aspects. Quantitative data is gathered from a survey conducted at a university. The qualitative phase encompasses an industrial focus group, initially starting with the factors from the literature and refined through participants' field experience. Findings indicate that a high correlation exists between several social factors that are reported by the focus group. Finally, initial results suggest that understanding the factors that affect social capital in software development is essential for building and sustaining highly productive development environments.

In these more traditional situations of performance improvement, the criterion of reliability is often coupled with that of productivity. This article captures the contribution of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) technology to the reliability and productivity of new product development. Through a longitudinal case study within an industrial group of small appliances, we study the effects of PLM on productivity and reliability through explicit knowledge integration, routines and actors' vigilance. We highlight the non-adversarial nature of productivity and reliability in two different contexts, co-development and internal development, and discuss the joint effects of PLM and of context on these two dimensions of performance. © 2009 M@n@gement and the author(s).","New product development; Performance; Product Lifecycle Management; Productivity; Reliability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baccarini, D., The concept of complexity - a review (1996) International Journal of Project Management, 14 (4), pp. 201-204; Banker, R., Chang, H., Kao, Y., Impact of information technology on public accounting firm productivity (2001) Journal of Information Systems, 16 (2), pp. 209-222; Batenburg, R., Helms, R., Versendaal, J., The maturity of product lifecycle management in Dutch organizations: A strategic alignment perspective, PLM'05 (2005) International conference on product life cycle management, , http://www.cs.uu.nl/research/techreps/repo/CS-2005/2005-009.pdf, Lyon, France; Bourgeon, L., Temporal context of organizational learning in new product development projects (2002) Creativity and Innovation Management, 11 (3), pp. 175-183; Boullier, D., (1995), L'usager, l'utilisateur et le récepteur: 12 ans d'exploration dans les machines à communiquer, Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches, Université Michel de Montaigne; Brion, S., La coordination par la vigilance collective réciproque (2005) Revue Française de Gestion, 154 (1), pp. 143-157; Brown, S.L., Eisenhardt, K., Product development: past research, present findings and future directions (1995) Academy of Management Review, 20 (2), pp. 343-378; Brown, S.L., Eisenhardt, K.M., The art of continuous change: linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations (1997) Administrative Science Quarterly, 42 (1), pp. 1-35; Brynjolfsson, E., Hitt, L., Paradox lost?

The book focuses on the following areas. Performance monitoring: Describes the state of the art in hardware and software tools that are commonly used for monitoring and measuring performance and managing large quantities of data Performance analysis: Discusses modern approaches to computer performance benchmarking and presents results that offer valuable insight into these studies Performance modeling: Explains how researchers deduce accurate performance models from raw performance data or from other high-level characteristics of a scientific computation Automatic performance tuning: Explores ongoing research into automatic and semi-automatic techniques for optimizing computer programs to achieve superior performance on any computer platform Application tuning: Provides examples that show how the appropriate analysis of performance and some deft changes have resulted in extremely high performance Performance analysis has grown into a full-fledged, sophisticated field of empirical science. Describing useful research in modern performance science and engineering, this book helps real-world users of parallel computer systems to better understand both the performance vagaries arising in scientific applications and the practical means for improving performance. © 2010 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Application programs; Computer hardware; Analysis of performance; Automatic performance tuning; Improving performance; Parallel computer systems; Performance monitoring; Science and engineering; Scientific applications; Scientific computation; Benchmarking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/faq.html, Frequently Asked Questions; http://www.netlib.org/blas; http://www.cactuscode.org/Community/NumericalRelativity; http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Errors.html; http://www.netlib.org; Queen Bee, the core supercomputer of LONI; http://www.top500.org; (2009), http://docs.cray.com/books/S-2315-50/html-S-2315-50/z1055157958smg.html; (2010) ROSE Web Reference, , http://www.rosecompiler.org; (2010) SciDAC Performance Engineering Research Institute, , http://www.peri-scidac.org/perci; Abramson, D., Lewis, A., Peachey, T., Fletcher, C., An automatic design optimization tool and its application to computational fluid dynamics (2001) Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing (SC01), p. 25. , New York, NY, ACM; Abreu, E.M., (2003) Gordon Moore sees another decade for Moore’s Law, , http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/biztechj/02/11/moore.law.reut, February 11; Adams, M.F., A distributed memory unstructured Gauss-Seidel algorithm for multigrid smoothers (2001) ACM/IEEE Proceedings of SC2001: High Performance Networking and Computing, , Denver, CO, November; Adams, M.F., Bayraktar, H.H., Keaveny, T.M., Papadopoulos, P., Ultrascalable implicit finite element analyses in solid mechanics with over a half a billion degrees of freedom (2004) ACM/IEEE Proceedings of SC2004: High Performance Networking and Computing, p. 356; Adams, M.F., Brezina, M., Hu, J.J., Tuminaro, R.S., Parallel multigrid smoothing: Polynomial versus Gauss-Seidel (2003) Journal of Computational Physics, 188 (2), pp. 593-610; Adhianto, L., Banerjee, S., Fagan, M., Krentel, M., Marin, G., Mellor-Crummey, J., Tallent, N.R., HPCToolkit: Tools for performance analysis of optimized parallel programs (2010) Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cpe.1553; Adhianto, L., Mellor-Crummey, J., Tallent, N.R., Effectively presenting call path profiles of application performance (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 Workshop on Parallel Software Tools and Tool Infrastructures, held in conjunction with the 2010 International Conference on Parallel Processing; Adiga, N.R., (2002) An overview of the BlueGene/L supercomputer, , November; AMD CodeAnalyst performance analyzer, , http://developer.amd.com/cpu/codeanalyst; Alcubierre, M., Brügmann, B., Diener, P., Koppitz, M., Pollney, D., Seidel, E., Takahashi, R., Gauge conditions for long-term numerical black hole evolutions without excision (2003) Physical Review D, 67, p. 084023; Alcubierre, M., Brügmann, B., Dramlitsch, T., Font, J.A., Papadopoulos, P., Seidel, E., Stergioulas, N., Takahashi, R., Towards a stable numerical evolution of strongly gravitating systems in general relativity: The conformal treatments (2000) Physical Review D, 62, p. 044034; Almgren, A.S., Bell, J.B., Colella, P., Howell, L.H., Welcome, M., (1998) A conservative adaptive projection method for the variable density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, 142, pp. 1-46; http://www.cct.lsu.edu/~eschnett/Alpaca; (2007) Instruction-Based Sampling: A New Performance Analysis Technique for AMD Family 10h Processors; Ammons, G., Ball, T., Larus, J.R., Exploiting hardware performance counterswith flow and context sensitive profiling (1997) SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, pp. 85-96. , New York, NY, USA, ACM; Anderson, J.M., Berc, L.M., Dean, J., Ghemawat, S., Henzinger, M.R., Leung, S.-T.A., Sites, R.L., Weihl, W.E., Continuous profiling: Where have all the cycles gone?

We divide overall software effort into software development effort, software quality conformance effort (EoC), and software maintenance non-conformance (EoNC) effort due to poor software quality at delivery time. Partitioning effort into software development and software quality metrics provides us a comprehensive model to measure productivity of software projects and to identify best practice projects. Some of positive productivity drivers from the DEA best practice efficient projects point to good customer rapport and application familiarity. Inefficient projects had problems such as customer requirements volatility, and the use of unfamiliar technology. The DEA results identify 12 “best practice” projects that can be emulated for software process improvement. Additionally, our results point to approximately 50 % potential for productivity improvement in software projects to get to the level of “best practice” projects. This study shows that including EoC and EoNC as inputs has a positive impact on the best practice frontier. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","CMMI; Data envelopment analysis; Fortune 500; Productivity; Software quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hill, P.R., (2010) Practical software project estimation: a toolkit for estimating software development effort & duration, , McGraw-Hill, San Francisco; Jalote, P., (2004) CMM in practice: processes for executing software projects at Infosys, , Pearson, Delhi; Flitman, A., Towards meaningful benchmarking of software development team productivity (2003) Benchmarking Int J, 10 (4), pp. 382-399; Paradi, J.C., Reese, D.N., Rosen, D., Applications of DEA to measure the efficiency of software production at two large Canadian banks (1997) Ann Oper Res, 73, pp. 91-115; Parthasarathy, S., Anbazhagan, N., Evaluating ERP projects using DEA and regression analysis (2008) Int J Bus Inf Syst, 3 (2), pp. 140-157; Stensrud, E., Myrtveit, I., Identifying high performance ERP projects (2003) IEEE Trans Comput, 29 (5), pp. 398-416; Yang, Z., Paradi, J.C., DEA evaluation of a Y2K software retrofit program (2004) IEEE Trans Eng Manag, 51 (3), pp. 279-287; Card, D.N., El Emam, K., Scalzo, B., (2001) Measurement of object-oriented software development projects, , Software Productivity Consortium NFP, Herndon; Basili, V.R., Briand, L.C., Melo, W.L., How reuse influences productivity in object-oriented systems (1996) Commun ACM, 39 (10), pp. 104-116; Blackburn, J.D., Scudder, G.D., Van Wassenhove, L.N., Improving speed and productivity of software development: a global survey of software developers (1996) IEEE Trans Softw Eng, 22 (12), pp. 875-885; Briand, L.C., El-Emam, K., Bomarius, F.C.O.B.R.A., A hybrid method for software cost estimation, benchmarking and risk assessment.

Although the prior OLM literature predominantly found systematic advantages for IT service providers from developed countries because of their higher perceived quality, the reality is that most service providers in OLM are from developing countries. This phenomenon requires a robust analysis of how OLMs are evolving. In this study, we conduct a geo-economic analysis on IT service providers' survival utilizing a unique longitudinal panel data set from an OLM, which comprises 40,874 IT service providers from different countries over a period of more than four years (2006 to 2010). Based on results from Survival models and a series of robustness checks, we were able to decipher how geoeconomic factors (specifically the country development level) and reputation interact to determine service providers' survival. Our findings provide a different perspective from the prior literature on OLM by showing a systematic advantage for IT service providers from developing countries in terms of survival, especially when providers from developing countries were able to signal their individual quality through reputation. We explain and discuss the mechanisms underlying these effects, and highlight implications for OLMs for IT services. © 2018 INFORMS.","Global online labor markets; International labor; IT services; Survival models","Commerce; Developing countries; Employment; Developed countries; Global competition; IT service providers; IT services; Labor markets; Perceived quality; Service provider; Survival model; Economic analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Gort, M., Firm and product life cycles and firm survival (2002) Amer.

Although an object of study in software engineering since the late sixties, achieving effective reuse remains challenging for many software development organizations. This paper reports a systematic mapping study on how reusability relates to other non-functional requirements and how different contextual factors influence the success of a reuse initiative. The conclusion is that the relationships are discussed rather informally, and that human, organizational, and technological domain factors are extremely relevant to a particular reuse context. This mapping study highlights the need for further research to better understand how exactly the different non-functional requirements and context factors affect reusability.

Interaction Design for 3D User Interfaces: The World of Modern Input Devices for Research, Applications, and Game Development addresses this paradigm shift by looking at user interfaces from an input perspective. The book is divided into four parts: Theory of input devices and user interfaces, with an emphasis on multi-touch interaction Advanced topics on reducing noise on input devices using Kalman Filters A collection of hands-on approaches that allows the reader to gain experience with some devices A case study examining speech as input Most of the chapters contain exercises that provide practical experience to enhance knowledge of the material in the related chapter. With its hands-on approach and the affordability of the required hardware, this book is an excellent flexible resource for both the novice and the expert in 3D user input device development. Researchers and practitioners will gain a much deeper understanding about user input devices and user interfaces. Game developers and software designers will find new techniques to improve their products by adding intuitive user interaction mechanisms to their games and applications. In addition to the resources provided in the book, its companion website, http://3DInputBook.com, provides additional resources, which include: additional exercises and project ideas, additional chapters, source code, and class instructors' resources. The additional resources are provided to keep helping you with new research and new technology as it becomes available to help you stay up to date. © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The most important theories will be the ones that most enable us to predict and then ultimately influence entrepreneurial performance. This book develops a new and more accurate theory of entrepreneurial performance based in entrepreneurial creativity. The field of entrepreneurship has a long tradition of expecting entrepreneurial performance to be influenced by creativity, tracing back even before the pioneering work of Joseph Schumpeter (1883 to 1950), who defined entrepreneurship as creative-destruction—creating the new by supplanting or destroying the old. Subsequently, psychologist Robert Sternberg defined creativity as broadly encompassing creative aspects of personality, motivation, intellect, thinking style and relevant knowledge. Using Sternberg’s definition of creativity, the authors reviewed the evidence directly linking entrepreneurial creativity and entrepreneurial performance, concluding that the linkage is both statistically and practically significant. In order to scientifically tie entrepreneurship to creativity the book pursues a number of major objectives: In parts one and two, the authors remind us of our scientific challenge in the light of the depressing levels of performance typically to be found in the real world of entrepreneurship and explores the limitations of the dominant paradigms driving research in the field of entrepreneurship today. In part three, they bring together existing evidence to demonstrate the predictive and explanatory powers of creativity in relation to entrepreneurship. In part four, they further explore correlations between creativity and entrepreneurial performance at the individual and macro or society, levels. In summary, the book offers a bold predictive theory linking entrepreneurial creativity to entrepreneurial performance, however neither as boldly as a definitional linkage nor as timidly as one in a hundred or so factors potentially explaining entrepreneurial performance. This result is a general scientific theory that offers a serious challenge to entrepreneurial scholars who are pursuing other means for understanding the causality of entrepreneurial performance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abra, J., Competition: Creativity’s vilified motive (1993) Genet Soc Gen Psychol Monogr, 119 (3), pp. 291-343; Abra, J., Do the muses dwell in Elysium?

Look no further. How to Recruit and Hire Great Software Engineers: Building a Crack Development Team is a field guide and instruction manual for finding and hiring excellent engineers that fit your team, drive your success, and provide you with a competitive advantage. Focusing on proven methods, the book guides you through creating and tailoring a hiring process specific to your needs. You'll learn to establish, implement, evaluate, and fine-tune a successful hiring process from beginning to end. Some studies show that really good programmers can be as much as 5 or even 10 times more productive than the rest. How do you find these rock star developers? Patrick McCuller, an experienced engineering and hiring manager, has made answering that question part of his life's work, and the result is this book. It covers sourcing talent, preparing for interviews, developing questions and exercises that reveal talent (or the lack thereof), handling common and uncommon situations, and onboarding your new hires. How to Recruit and Hire Great Software Engineers will make your hiring much more effective, providing a long-term edge for your projects. It will: Teach you everything you need to know to find and evaluate great software developers. Explain why and how you should consider candidates as customers, which makes offers easy to negotiate and close. Give you the methods to create and engineer an optimized process for your business from job description to onboarding and the hundreds of details in between. Provide analytical tools and metrics to help you improve the quality of your hires. This book will prove invaluable to new managers. But McCuller's deep thinking on the subject will also help veteran managers who understand the essential importance of finding just the right person to move projects forward.

Emotion classification has been proven useful for measuring aspects such as user satisfaction. Despite its usefulness, research in emotion classification is limited, because the task is multi-label and publicly available data sets and lexica are very limited. A number of emotion classifiers for general-domain text have been proposed recently, but only a few for text in the domain of Open Source Software (OSS), such as EmoTxt. In this paper, we explore different lexica and two multi-label algorithms for classifying emotions in text related to OSS. We trained various multi-label classifiers using HOMER and RAkEL on a data set of Stack Overflow posts and a data set of JIRA Issue Tracker comments. The classifiers have been enriched with features derived from different state-of-the-art lexica. We achieved multi-label Micro F-scores up to 0.811 and Subset 0/1 Loss of 0.290. These results represent a statistically significant improvement over the state-of-the-art. © 2020 The Authors","Emotion classification; Jira Issue Tracker; Multi-label classification; Stack Overflow","Open source software; Open systems; Emotion classification; Jira Issue Tracker; Multi label classification; Multi-label; Social media; Stack overflow; State of the art; User satisfaction; Classification (of information)",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 732223","This research has been carried out as part of the CROSSMINER Project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No. 732223.","This research has been carried out as part of the CROSSMINER Project , which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No . 732223 .",,,,,,,,,"Cambria, E., Livingstone, A., Hussain, A., The hourglass of emotions (2012) Cognitive Behavioural Systems, pp. 144-157. , Esposito A.

The productivity measure has become a tool for managers since it is used to compare the performance between different companies (benchmarking) and to compare the efficiency of different developers in the same company. Therefore, it allows doing strategic planning and decision making based on such measurement. A variety of international standardization bodies such as IEEE and ISO as well as software engineering researchers have proposed a set of factors which influence the software productivity attribute, and also a set of measures to evaluate it. However, there is no unique model that integrates all the software productivity best practices. The aim of this paper is to survey the available international standards and research work on software productivity and figure out the key differences in order to propose a standards-based model. Such model will include the set of quality attributes that could be used to reflect the software productivity, and a set of measures that allows evaluating the software developer's productivity. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","IEEE Std. 1045; ISO 9126; Measurements; Productivity drivers; Quality attributes; Quality models; Software developers productivity","IEEE Std. 1045; International standardization; International standards; ISO 9126; Productivity measure; Quality attributes; Quality models; Software developer; Software engineering standards; Software productivity; Software Quality; Benchmarking; Computer software selection and evaluation; Industry; Management; Measurements; Productivity; Standards; Software engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2010) Oxford English Dictionary, , 2nd edition, Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; de Aquino, G.S., de Lemos, M.S.R., Towards Effective Productivity Measurement In Software Projects Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Software Engineering Advances - (ACSEA'09), pp. 241-249. , Porto, Prazil, September 20-25, 2009; Buglione, L., Abran, A., Multidimensional Software Performance Measurement Models: A Tetrahedron-Based Design (1999) Software Measurement: Current Trends In Research and Practice, pp. 93-107. , In R.

Such platforms contain rich data sources, e.g., code snippets, documentations, and user discussions, that can be useful for supporting development activities. Over the last decades, several techniques and tools have been promoted to provide developers with innovative features, aiming to bring in improvements in terms of development effort, cost savings, and productivity. In the context of the EU H2020 CROSSMINER project, a set of recommendation systems has been conceived to assist software programmers in different phases of the development process. The systems provide developers with various artifacts, such as third-party libraries, documentation about how to use the APIs being adopted, or relevant API function calls. To develop such recommendations, various technical choices have been made to overcome issues related to several aspects including the lack of baselines, limited data availability, decisions about the performance measures, and evaluation approaches. This paper is an experience report to present the knowledge pertinent to the set of recommendation systems developed through the CROSSMINER project. We explain in detail the challenges we had to deal with, together with the related lessons learned when developing and evaluating these systems. Our aim is to provide the research community with concrete takeaway messages that are expected to be useful for those who want to develop or customize their own recommendation systems. The reported experiences can facilitate interesting discussions and research work, which in the end contribute to the advancement of recommendation systems applied to solve different issues in Software Engineering. © 2021, The Author(s).","Empirical evaluation; Experience report; Recommendation systems","Application programming interfaces (API); Engineering research; Open source software; Recommender systems; API function calls; Development activity; Development process; Evaluation approach; Performance measure; Recommendation systems for software engineerings; Research communities; Techniques and tools; Open systems",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 732223","The research described in this paper has been carried out as part of the CROSSMINER Project, which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant 732223.

In providing a new perspective on the integration and adoption of usability engineering methods by software development teams, this book demonstrates that usability engineering methods can only be integrated in the software development process when they are fully adopted by the project teams. The authors present an adoption centric usability engineering approach that consists of a process meta-model for guiding project teams in the deployment of usability engineering methods and provide a framework for measuring the acceptance of the deployed methods. Software developers, managers and educators from both academia and industry will find this comprehensible, step-by-step approach to integrating usability engineering methods in the software development lifecycle a useful guide in extending and improving on methodologies, and complementary to existing software development strategies. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agyris, C., Schön, D., Organizational learning: A theory of action perspective (1978) A Review of Literature on Organizational Learning, pp. 316-336. , C.

But which options will have the biggest impact? Drawing from the literature in software engineering and industrial/organizational psychology to identify factors that correlate with productivity, we designed a survey that asked 622 developers across 3 companies about these productivity factors and about self-rated productivity. Our results suggest that the factors that most strongly correlate with self-rated productivity were non-technical factors, such as job enthusiasm, peer support for new ideas, and receiving useful feedback about job performance. Compared to other knowledge workers, our results also suggest that software developers' self-rated productivity is more strongly related to task variety and ability to work remotely. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","knowledge workers; Productivity factors; software engineers","Computer software; Industry; Job analysis; Knowledge management; Software engineering; Time measurement; Tools; Google; Job performance; Knowledge workers; Non-technical factors; Office layouts; Productivity factors; Software developer; Task analysis; Productivity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nickerson, R.S., Confirmation bias: A ubiquitous phenomenon in many guises (1998) Rev.General Psychology, 2 (2); Ramirez, Y.W., Nembhard, D.A., Measuring knowledge worker productivity: A taxonomy (2004) J.

Different perspectives are used to study OL by researchers from different disciplines. It can be said that there is no single framework for the study of OL. To have a better understanding of OL, it is thus critical to explore how an organization may be transitioned into an LO and how its OL process is initiated, driven, enabled, facilitated and measured. This chapter introduces OL as a continuous process called DELO (driving, enabling, learning and outcome). Each of the core components along the DELO process is discussed in detail. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Human resource management; Knowledge management; Continuous improvements; Continuous process; Core components; Learning cultures; Learning motivation; Learning process; Organizational development; Organizational learning; Education",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alderfer, C.P., (1972) Existence, Relatedness and Growth Human Needs in Organizational Settings, , Free Press, New York; Allee, V., 12 principles of knowledge management (1997) Training Dev, 51 (11), p. 71; Ambrose Maureen, L., Kulik Carol, T., Old friends, new faces: Motivation research in the 1990s (1999) J Manag, 25 (3), pp. 231-292; Argyris, C., Schon, D., (1978) Organizational Learning: A Theory of Action Perspective, , Addison-Wesley, London; Argyris, C., Schon, D., (1996) Organizational Learning II: Theory, Method, and Practice, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Atul, G., Glen, T., Organizational learning in a high-tech environment: From theory to practice (2001) Ind Manage Data Syst, 101 (9), pp. 502-507; Bierly Paul, I., Kessler Eric, H., Christensen Edward, W., Organizational learning, knowledge and wisdom (2000) J Organ Change Manage, 13 (6), p. 595; Bollinger Audrey, S., Smith Robert, D., Managing organizational knowledge as a strategic asset (2001) J Knowl Manage, 5 (1), pp. 8-183; Bourne, M., Neely, A., Platts, K., Mills, J., The success and failure of performance measurement initiatives: Perceptions of participating managers (2002) Int J Oper Prod Manage, 22 (11), pp. 1288-1310; Browaeys, M.J., Baets, W., Cultural complexity: A new epistemological perspective (2003) The Learning Organization, 10 (6), pp. 332-339; Burgoyne, J., (1999) Design of Times.

The author introduces and demonstrates the powerful strategy of ""Managed Evolution,"" along with the engineering best practice known as ""Principle-based Architecting."" The book examines in detail architecture principles for e.g., Business Value, Changeability, Resilience, and Dependability. The author argues that the software development community has a strong responsibility to produce and operate useful, dependable, and trustworthy software. Software should at the same time provide business value and guarantee many quality-of-service properties, including security, safety, performance, and integrity. As Dr. Furrer states, ""Producing dependable software is a balancing act between investing in the implementation of business functionality and investing in the quality-of-service properties of the software-systems."" The book presents extensive coverage of such concepts as: Principle-Based Architecting. Managed Evolution Strategy. The Future. Principles for Business Value. Legacy Software Modernization/Migration. Architecture Principles for Changeability. Architecture Principles for Resilience. Architecture Principles for Dependability. The text is supplemented with numerous figures, tables, examples and illustrative quotations. Future-Proof Software-Systems provides a set of good engineering practices, devised for integration into most software development processes dedicated to the creation of software-systems that incorporate Managed Evolution. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, part of Springer Nature 2019.

In the scrum process, there are several events performed on each sprint in order to monitor team performance. Conducting an objective performance measurement in the agile process meet some challenges due to the differences in team preferences and project complexity. This paper discusses the software measurement metrics and their fundamental role in scrum software development life cycle. We review software metrics on scrum context based on 13 selected literatures. Software metrics are grouped by measurement objectives and scrum events goal. We discuss 34 software metrics distributed in scrum events; sprint planning, daily scrum meetings, sprint review and sprint retrospective. Then, we perform a unique classification and provide a set of recommendation software metrics to implement scrum based on entire project management perspectives to conduct a proper performance measurement. © 2018 IEEE.","Agile development process; Project management; Scrum development process; Scrum framework; Software metrics","Agile manufacturing systems; Computer software; Intelligent systems; Life cycle; Project management; Agile development; Development process; Performance measurements; Project complexity; Scrum framework; Software development life cycle; Software Measurement; Software metrics; Software design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2014) 8th Annual-State of Agile Survey., , Versionone.com; Beck, K., (2001) Manifesto for Agile Software Development; Downey, S., Sutherland, J., Scrum metrics for hyperproductive teams: How they fly like fighter aircraft (2013) Proc.

The software, that traditionally had been developed in house by the IT departments, is now usually outsourced to IT firms. These firms work under the software factories model. An important feature within this sector is that usually the financial groups keep the ownership of these firms because the strategic value of the software for the core business. These firms work almost exclusively for the owner financial group developing their software, but they have to demonstrate that they are so profitable and competitive like any other firm. The organizational structure of these firms has some differential features. Top level tasks (software design and project management) are usually performed by the IT firm but the development is usually subcontracted to other software companies. Although financial corporations have always paid a special interest to investing in management and organizational policies to improve their efficiency, there have being always an important lack regarding to the control and monitoring of the software projects. They do not have suitable tools for monitoring actual process effectiveness. Adapting scorecards to this environment could be a useful tool for monitoring and improvement the process. Scorecard could here be used both as a tool for internal effectiveness measurement as well as externally, presenting sustainability indicators for the shareholders, the financial institutions. This paper aims to identify and define a collection of Key Performance Indicators which permit effectiveness to be improved under this context, focusing in the specific supply-chain model given by owner (financial group), software factory and software developers (subcontracted). © 2013, SciKA.","Balanced Scorecard; Efficiency; Financial software development; KPIs; Software factory",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Asprón, R.F., Medir la productividad del desarrollo de software en Banca (2010) Financial Tech Magazine, 217. , July; Garzás, J., Cabrero, D., (2007) El Valor Y El Retorno De La inversión En TSI.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of work engagement in mediating the association of these resources with work performance and work withdrawal behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling on data obtained from 369 software developers in India. Findings: Findings demonstrate that reverse mentoring and job crafting are positively related to work engagement, which, in turn, increase performance and decreases work withdrawal behaviors. Work engagement partially mediates the association of job crafting with both outcomes. In contrast, work engagement fully mediates the relationship between reverse mentoring and withdrawal behavior and partially mediates the relationship between reverse mentoring and work performance. Research limitations/implications: This study is a cross-sectional, survey design in the understudied technical industry in India, which may limit generalizability. However, the authors also connect the previously unrelated literatures on reverse mentoring and work engagement and develop a scale for use in future reverse mentoring studies. Practical implications: This study provides evidence to support practitioners in implementing resources for reverse mentoring and job crafting to increase work engagement among employees and subsequent positive outcomes. Originality/value: Organizations can support reverse mentoring and job crafting as cost effective employee development tools. The research focuses on the mentors, who tend to be the less experienced and younger counterparts in a reverse mentoring pair and a critical part of the workforce for the growing IT industry. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","India; Job crafting; Performance; Reverse mentoring; Work engagement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abramis, D.J., (1985) Job Stressors, Strains, Job Performance, Social Support, and Social Conflict: Causal Relationships in A Four-Wave Longitudinal Panel Study (Structural Model, Health, Work), , Doctoral dissertation; Agarwal, U.A., Gupta, V., Relationships between job characteristics, work engagement, conscientiousness and managers' turnover intentions: a moderated-mediation analysis (2018) Personnel Review, 47 (2), pp. 353-377; Allen, T.D., Eby, L.T., Poteet, M.L., Lentz, E., Lima, L., Career benefits associated with mentoring for protégés: a meta-analysis (2004) Journal of Applied Psychology, 89 (1), p. 127; Allen, T.D., Smith, M.A., Mael, F.A., Gavan O'Shea, P., Eby, L.T., Organization-level mentoring and organizational performance within substance abuse centers (2009) Journal of Management, 35 (5), pp. 1113-1128; Arbuckle, J.L., (2016) IBM SPSS Amos 24.0.

This study examined the relationships between job analysis, job performance, and procedural justice among local employees in Jordan Industrial Estates. The literature demonstrated gaps in knowledge regarding the relationships between these variables in developing countries, which are intended to be filled by this study. The study drew from the pay model and equity theory. Data were collected with a survey questionnaire from 690 Jordanian employees working in three industrial estates. The data were analyzed through structural equation modelling (SEM) using SPSS and AMOS software tools. The results indicated to a significant positive relationship between job analysis and job performance, job analysis and procedural justice, and a positive relationship between procedural justice and job performance. Also, it is found that procedural justice mediates the relationship between job analysis and job performance. It is expected that the results of this study would have an impact on employee's performance through the fair implementation of one of the human resources practices, namely, job analysis, and thus organizational performance. Also, it contributes to the body of knowledge and supports the mediating role of procedural justice in decisions taken within the organization. © 2020 The Authors","Arts and humanities; Businesss; Environmental science; Job analysis; Job performance; Jordan Industrial Estates; Procedural justice; Social sciences",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbas, Q., Yaqoob, S., Effect of leadership development on employees performance in Pakistan (2009) Pakistan Econ.

But how do interdependence and autonomy affect team cohesiveness, an important antecedent of team performance? The results of this multi-year study with software development projects show that task interdependence and task autonomy have both synergistic and antagonistic impacts on team cohesiveness. At high levels of outcome (goal) interdependence, task autonomy and task interdependence have a synergistic impact on team cohesion, while at low levels of outcome interdependence, task autonomy and task interdependence have an antagonistic impact on team cohesion. Further, taylorist teams showed lower cohesiveness compared to agile teams. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomy; Outcome interdependence; Task interdependence; Team cohesiveness","Adhesion; Autonomy; Outcome interdependence; Software development projects; Software development teams; Task interdependence; Team cohesiveness; Team designs; Team performance; Software design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L., West, S., Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions (1991), Sage Thousand Oaks, CA; Abrahamsson, P., Conboy, K., Wang, X., Lots done, more to do’: the current state of agile systems development research (2009) Euro.

A controlled experiment was designed with 238 students, quantifying their personality traits through the “big five inventory” (BFI), forming working groups and developing a collaborative activity in programming and related courses. The experiment results allowed valida-tion, not only from a computational point of view evaluating the algorithm performance but also from a pedagogical point of view, confronting the results obtained by students applying the proposed approach with those obtained through other group formation strategies. The highlight of the study is that those groups whose formation was pre-established by the teachers through the proposed strategy have generally had a better collaborative performance than the groups with tradi-tional formation, except in the case of heterogeneous formation, at the time of developing a collaborative activity. In addition, through the experiment, it was found that not considering criteria related to personality traits before the group formation generally led to lower results. © 2021 by the authors.

Here we introduce a new approach (LANLAN), using word embeddings and machine learning, to harness information available in StackOverflow. Specifically, we consider two different kinds of user communication describing difficulties encountered in software reuse: ‘problem reports’ point to potential defects, while ‘support requests’ ask for clarification on software usage. Word embeddings were trained on 1.6 billion tokens from StackOverflow and applied to identify which Q&A forum messages (from two large open source projects: Eclipse and Bioconductor) correspond to problem reports or support requests. LANLAN achieved an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of over 0.9; it can be used to explore the relationship between software reusability metrics and difficulties encountered by users, as well as predict the number of difficulties users will face in the future. Q&A forum data can help improve understanding of software reuse, and may be harnessed as an additional resource to evaluate software reusability metrics. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Machine learning; Reusability; Software reuse; StackOverflow; Text mining","Embeddings; Open source software; Reusability; Free texts; New approaches; Open source projects; Potential defects; Receiver operator curves; User communication; Computer software reusability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdalkareem, R., Shihab, E., Rilling, J., What do developers use the crowd for?

Code smells can be detected using tools such as static analyzer that detects code smells based on source code metrics. Further, developers perform refactoring activities based on the result of such detection tools to improve source code quality. However, such approach can be considered as reactive refactoring, i.e., developers react to code smells after they occur. This means that developers first suffer the effects of low quality source code (e.g., low readability and understandability) before they start solving code smells. In this study, we focus on proactive refactoring, i.e., refactoring source code before it becomes smelly. This approach would allow developers to maintain source code quality without having to suffer the impact of code smells. To support the proactive refactoring process, we propose a technique to detect decaying modules, which are non-smelly modules that are about to become smelly. We present empirical studies on open source projects with the aim of studying the characteristics of decaying modules. Additionally, to facilitate developers in the refactoring planning process, we perform a study on using a machine learning technique to predict decaying modules and report a factor that contributes most to the performance of the model under consideration. © 2019 IEEE.","Code quality; Code smell; Refactoring","Computer programming languages; Learning systems; Odors; Open source software; Code quality; Code smell; Exploratory studies; Machine learning techniques; Open source projects; Refactorings; Source code metrics; Source code qualities; Codes (symbols)",,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: JP15H02683, JP15H02685, JP15K15970, JP18K11238","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was partly supported by JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research Numbers JP18K11238, JP15K15970, JP15H02683, and JP15H02685.","This work was partly supported by JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research Numbers JP18K11238, JP15K15970, JP15H02683, and JP15H02685.",,,,,,,,,"Fowler, M., (1999) Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, , Addison-Wesley; Lanza, M., Marinescu, R., (2006) Object-Oriented Metrics in Practice, , Springer; Yamashita, A., Moonen, L., Do code smells reflect important maintainability aspects?

The next generation well planning tools will take the steps to higher levels of automation, which can provide step changes in quality of the planning, safety aspects in operations and reduce time and cost for planning and operations. This article discusses the changes that will follow a new standard in well planning and operations. Analysis of the current practices and investigating the potential of a fully automated planning tool leads to a complete re-structuring of the work process. Well planning is a multidisciplinary activity where representatives from the different subsurface disciplines collaborates with the wells engineers in a compromise-prone process often with multiple iterations due to the differences in objective and understanding. The arrival of cross discipline 3D visualization tools has led to improvements in average duration of planning, but it is still a process depending on the efforts of the participating individuals and their level of experience. In an era where computers are landing passenger planes and the pilot has a verification role, it is time to look at the potential in digitalization for well planning and operations. Many software developers are familiar with the difficulty in developing a ""solution"" to a challenge in a complex environment such as well construction and production. Many areas of expertise are involved and it is easy to end up with a compartmentalized product which is specialized for one area or a specific challenge. Establishing links and communication to all engineering and calculations in Wells, Subsurface and Production (e.g. well integrity data) are a matter of cost and safety. The next generation well planning tools has to incorporate all areas of expertise from planning well construction, through producing wells to final P&A. The key enabler for automating the well planning process is the digital experience module, which will be the main task and focus for the Wells Teams. With built in experience, the application has rules and enhanced algorithms allowing Subsurface Teams to make accurate well plans and mature optimal well designs without involving the Wells Teams. Subsurface can identify the optimal drainage and well path including anti-collision, future side tracks, regulations in governing documentation and follow ""local best practice"". The Wells teams are ultimately responsible and will verify the well path generated by the software, and do any required updates.

Breaking out of this flow can cause the developer to lose their train of thought and have to start their thought process from the beginning. This loss of thought can be caused by interruptions and sometimes slow IDE interactions. Predictive functionality has been harnessed in user applications to speed up load times, such as in Google Chrome's browser which has a feature called ""Predicting Network Actions"". This will pre-load web-pages that the user is most likely to click through. This mitigates the interruption that load times can introduce. In this paper we seek to make the first step towards predicting user commands in the IDE. Using the MSR 2018 Challenge Data of over 3000 developer session and over 10 million recorded events, we analyze and cleanse the data to be parsed into event series, which can then be used to train a variety of machine learning models, including a neural network, to predict user induced commands. Our highest performing model is able to obtain a 5 cross-fold validation prediction accuracy of 64%. © 2018 ACM.","developer commands; IDE monitoring; machine learning; neural network","Artificial intelligence; Forecasting; Integrodifferential equations; Neural networks; Software engineering; Websites; Click through; developer commands; Machine learning models; Most likely; Prediction accuracy; Thought process; User commands; Writing codes; Learning systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beller, M., Gousios, G., Panichella, A., Zaidman, A., When, how, and why developers (do not) test in their ides (2015) Proc. 2015 10th Jt.

Ever since the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration required greater infusion of technology into the curriculum, faculty and administrators have struggled with finding the right course materials designed specifically for the public administration environment. Technology is no longer the sole domain of an information technology office, as it has evolved into a growing set of complex tools that influence every area of government. To be effective, every public manager needs to be actively engaged in technology decisions. This textbook is designed for students of public administration at every level who need to know and understand how technology can be applied in today's public management workplace. The book explores the latest trends in public management, policy, and technology and focuses on best practices on governance issues. Finally, this book provides real-life examples about the need for policies and procedures to safeguard our technology infrastructure while providing greater openness, participation, and transparency. Technology and Public Management covers: How information system design relates to democratic theory. How and where public policy and technology intersect. Skills and tools that are useful in information management, information technology, and systems dedicated for the effective flow of information within organizations. Understanding the role of e-government, m-government, and social media in today's society and in public organizations. Possibilities and challenges associated with technology applications within public organizations. How technology can be managed, through various governance models. The latest technology trends and their potential impact on public administration. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

In this study, the four mentioned elements are evaluated through a survey in different EPC project-based organizations. The survey is sent to only experts and managers who are involved in EPC projects, and the obtained data is used to test the relationship between the mentioned variables and the lead time of developing new products. This evaluation is followed by a set of generalized lessons learned and courses of action to improve the development process. Additionally, the attributes of performance measurement in such projects are scrutinized. Therefore, to analyze the impacts of the mentioned variables and their variations on the performance measurement, a mathematical model based on the fuzzy approach is developed. The results show that all of the four considered variables are correlated to the lead time and affect the quality perceived by the main client and the cost of the project. Moreover, data obtained from the proposed mathematical formulations illustrated that the fuzzy modeling approach is an effective method to predict the performance measurement level when the levels of the input variables are given.

Taking the perspective of dynamic capability theory, our study sheds light on the effect that heterogeneity in experiential learning has on international new venture (INV) growth in terms of a curvilinear relationship. Specifically, we introduce the concept of internationalisation path heterogeneity to capture the path-specific features of INV experiential learning and capability building and explore the relationship between internationalisation path heterogeneity and INV firm growth. We also argue that this relationship will be moderated by environmental munificence because the cost and benefit of path heterogeneity is bounded. We test the hypotheses based on empirical analysis of a longitudinal dataset of 1054 INVs from 58 countries. Overall, this study provides a dynamic and fine-grained view of the role played by internationalisation path heterogeneity in driving the growth of INVs. © The Author(s) 2020.","dynamic capability; firm growth; international new venture; path heterogeneity",,,,,,,"The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.",,,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, A., Engaging the inventor: Exploring licensing strategies for university inventions and the role of latent knowledge (2006) Strategic Management Journal, 27 (1), pp. 63-79; Al-Aali, A., Teece, D.J., International entrepreneurship and the theory of the (long-lived) international firm: A capabilities perspective (2014) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 38 (1), pp. 95-116; Amason, A.C., Shrader, R.C., Tompson, G.H., Newness and novelty: Relating top management team composition to new venture performance (2006) Journal of Business Venturing, 21 (1), pp. 125-148; Arthurs, J.D., Busenitz, L.W., Dynamic capabilities and venture performance: The effects of venture capitalists (2006) Journal of Business Venturing, 21 (2), pp. 195-215; Autio, E., Sapienza, H.J., Almeida, J.G., Effects of age at entry, knowledge intensity, and imitability on international growth (2000) Academy of Management Journal, 43 (5), pp. 909-924; Barreto, I., Dynamic capabilities: A review of past research and an agenda for the future (2010) Journal of Management, 36 (1), pp. 256-280; Baum, J.A.C., Singh, J.V., Organizational niches and the dynamics of organizational mortality (1994) American Journal of Sociology, 100 (2), pp. 346-380; Baum, J.R., Locke, E.A., Smith, K.G., A multidimensional model of venture growth (2001) Academy of Management Journal, 44, pp. 292-303; Belderbos, R., Du, H.S., Goerzen, A., Global cities, connectivity, and the location choice of MNC regional headquarters (2017) Journal of Management Studies, 54 (8), pp. 1271-1302; Bhaumik, S.K., Driffield, N., Pal, S., Does ownership structure of emerging-market firms affect their outward FDI?

This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to survey the existing NeuroSE literature. Based on a rigorous search protocol, we identified 89 papers (hereafter denoted as NeuroSE papers). We analyzed these papers to develop a comprehensive understanding of who had published NeuroSE research and classified the contributions according to their type. The 47 articles presenting completed empirical research were analyzed in detail. The SLR revealed that the number of authors publishing NeuroSE research is still relatively small. The thematic focus so far has been on code comprehension, while code inspection, programming, and bug fixing have been less frequently studied. NeuroSE publications primarily used methods related to brain activity measurement (particularly fMRI and EEG), while methods related to the measurement of autonomic nervous system activity (e.g., pupil dilation, heart rate, skin conductance) received less attention. We also present details of how the empirical research was conducted, including stimuli and independent and dependent variables, and discuss implications for future research. The body of NeuroSE literature is still small. Yet, high quality contributions exist constituting a valuable basis for future studies. © 2021 The Author(s)","Brain and autonomic nervous system activity measurements; Electroencephalography (EEG); Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Heart- and skin-related measurements; Software engineering; Systematic literature review","Reviews; Software engineering; Autonomic nervous system activities; Code comprehension; Dependent variables; Empirical research; Implications for futures; Skin conductance; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Brain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abid, N.J., Sharif, B., Dragan, N., Alrasheed, H., Maletic, J.I., Developer reading behavior while summarizing java methods: Size and context matters (2019) 2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), pp. 384-395; Adam, M.T.P., Gimpel, H., Maedche, A., Riedl, R., Design blueprint for stress-sensitive adaptive enterprise systems (2017) Bus.

Focusing on a set of students who completed all programming assignments in the course, we quantify differences in productivity, measured through the time spent on completing the assignments. We focus both on the overall time needed to complete all programming assignments in the course, as well as on time spent on individual programming assignments. In addition, the effect of previous programming experience and difficulty of the programming assignment is considered. Our results show significant productivity differences between students. In addition, while programming experience influences productivity, a proportion of students who have never programmed before are faster in completing the programming assignments than students with considerable amounts of previous programming experience. Our results suggest that the classic credit-based or lecture hour based workload estimates of a course fit poorly to the whole course population in programming, suggesting that programming courses and training should be adjusted based on the participant. © 2020 IEEE.","CS1; expert; novice; productivity; programming; time on task","Productivity; Introductory programming course; Programming assignments; Programming course; Programming experience; Programming problem; Research papers; Time spent; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sackman, H., Man-computer communication: Experimental investigation of user effectiveness (1968) Proceedings of the Sixth SIGCPR Conference on Computer Personnel Research, Ser.

This resulted in an increase in the competition among Logistics Service Providers (LSPs), which requires a careful performance measurement in order to consolidate their position in the logistics market. However, the literature on such a topic does not pay appropriate attention to how LSPs actually monitor their performance and to the degree of support that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools can give to the measurement process. In this work a survey is completed to investigate the performance indicators used by LSPs as well as how Software Developers’ (SDs) applications support their measurement. A comparison between the metrics adopted by LSPs and those proposed by SDs is carried out by means of a logistics performance measurement model well known in literature. © 2018, Levrotto and Bella.

Before ICT can be fully assimilated into the public domain, it will first be necessary to successfully conciliate users to their adoption. ICT Adoption and Application in the Malaysian Public Sector aims to resolve the difficulties in applying practical ICT systems within the public sphere, thoroughly addressing disparities in ICT theory, user attitudes, and the underlying factors that hinder the full adoption of ICT systems.

Especially within the context of Innovation Ecosystems (IEs), KIEs play a central role in modern innovation research. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted strongpoints and deficiencies in the broader ecosystems, the companies themselves, and most importantly, their founders and employees. Despite the external hindrances, many enterprises found growth driven by their ecosystems’ dynamic and their staffs’ capabilities. Combining insights from a quantitative survey, with actual growth data in the context of a Venture Capital (VC)-driven IE, we argue that enterprise profile - as defined by its innovation capability and its members’ personal, organizational, and demographic characteristics – affect KIE growth potential, and actual growth. In addition, we argue that both enterprise profile, as well as KIE growth, affect its members’ emotional reaction to the Covid-19 crisis, in terms of worry, hope, and optimism. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Ecosystem; Growth; Innovative; Knowledge Intensive Entrepreneurship; Organizational; Profile; Venture Capital",,,,,,,"We would like to thank Associate Professor Katerina Pramatari for her continued support and advice throughout our research efforts.",,,,,,,,,,"Acs, Z.J., Stam, E., Audretsch, D.B., O'Connor, A., The lineages of the entrepreneurial ecosystem approach (2017) Small Business Economics, 49 (1), pp. 1-10; Adner, R., Match your innovation strategy to your innovation ecosystem (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (4), p. 98; Adner, R., Ecosystem as Structure: An Actionable Construct for Strategy (2017) Journal of Management, 43 (1), pp. 39-58; Amason, A.C., Shrader, R.C., Tompson, G.H., Newness and novelty: Relating top management team composition to new venture performance (2006) Journal of Business Venturing, 21 (1), pp. 125-148; Amit, R., Glosten, L., Muller, E., Challenges To Theory Development in Entrepreneurship Research (1993) Journal of Management Studies, 30 (5), pp. 815-834; Aspelund, A., Berg-Utby, T., Skjevdal, R., Initial resources’ influence on new venture survival: A longitudinal study of new technology-based firms (2005) Technovation, 25 (11), pp. 1337-1347; Autio, E., Thomas, L., Innovation ecosystems (2014) The Oxford Handbook of Innovation, , Management; Banc, C., Messeghem, K., Discovering the entrepreneurial micro-ecosystem: The case of a corporate accelerator (2020) Thunderbird International Business Review, 62 (5), pp. 593-605; (2021), https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/innovation-in-a-crisis-why-it-is-more-critical-than-ever, Bar Am, J., Furstenthal, L., Jorge, F., & Roth, E.

Evidence from literature uncovered that lean implementation in the manufacturing industry worsens the workers' health and safety due to the lack of consideration of social aspects. This ignorance has forced SMEs to focus on considering social aspects along with economic and environmental aspects for improving their workers' health and safety. Therefore, this study aims to develop a tool that integrates lean and ergonomics to improve the workers' health and safety, along with operational performance. Hence, Human Factors and Ergonomic (HFE) indicators were incorporated into the VSM tool under a fuzzy environment. The Fuzzy-based Ergonomic-Value Stream Mapping (E-VSM) tool identifies the area of scope for ergonomic and managerial interventions at the workplace and evaluates the HFE indicators with lean indicators. This integrated tool helps management to improve the Workers’ health and safety and enhance operational performance synergistically. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ergonomics; human factors; lean; musculoskeletal disorders; VSM","Accident prevention; Ergonomics; Glass industry; Health; Mapping; Occupational risks; Social aspects; Health and safety; Human factors and ergonomics; Lean; Mapping tools; Musculoskeletal disorders; Operational performance; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Value stream mapping; VSM; Workers'; Human resource management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abeysekera, J., Illankoon, P., The Demands and Benefits of Ergonomics in Sri Lankan Apparel Industry: A Case Study at MAS Holdings (2016) Work, 55 (2), pp. 255-261; Alasim, H.N., Nimbarte, A.D., Jaridi, M., Impact of Pulling Direction and Magnitude of Force Exertion on the Activation of Shoulder Muscles (2019) International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 69, pp. 14-22; Alaskari, O., Ahmad, M.M., Pinedo-Cuenca, R., Development of a Methodology to Assist Manufacturing SMEs in the Selection of Appropriate Lean Tools (2016) International Journal of Lean Six Sigma, 7 (1), pp. 62-84; Arezes, P.M., Dinis-Carvalho, J., Alves, A.C., Workplace Ergonomics in Lean Production Environments: A Literature Review (2015) Work, 52 (1), pp. 57-70; Ayough, A., Zandieh, M., Farhadi, F., Balancing, Sequencing, and Job Rotation Scheduling of a U-Shaped Lean Cell with Dynamic Operator Performance (2020) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 143, p. 106363; Bhamu, J., Sangwan, K.S., Lean Manufacturing: literature Review and Research Issues (2014) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 34 (7), pp. 876-940; Bhuvanesh Kumar, M., Parameshwaran, R., (2018), pp. 403-417. , Fuzzy integrated QFD, FMEA framework for the Selection of Lean Tools a Manufacturing Organisation., Production Planning & Control, 29 (5; Botti, L., Mora, C., Regattieri, A., Integrating Ergonomics and Lean Manufacturing Principles in a Hybrid Assembly Line (2017) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 111, pp. 481-491; Bouville, G., Alis, D., The Effects of Lean Organizational Practices on Employees' Attitudes and Workers' Health: Evidence from France (2014) The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 25 (21), pp. 3016-3037; Brännmark, M., Håkansson, M., Lean Production and Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders: overviews of International and Swedish Studies (2012) Work, 41, pp. 2321-2328; Brito, M.F., Ramos, A.L., Carneiro, P., Gonçalves, M.A., A Continuous Improvement Assessment Tool, considering Lean, Safety and Ergonomics (2020) International Journal of Lean Six Sigma, 11 (5), pp. 879-902; Brito, M., Vale, M., Leão, J., Ferreira, L.P., Silva, F.J.G., Gonçalves, M.A., Lean and Ergonomics Decision Support Tool Assessment in a Plastic Packaging Company (2020) Procedia Manufacturing, 51, pp. 613-619; Brown, A., Amundson, J., Badurdeen, F., Sustainable Value Stream Mapping (Sus-VSM) in Different Manufacturing System Configurations: application Case Studies (2014) Journal of Cleaner Production, 85, pp. 164-179; Bush, A., Palasciano, C., Staudacher, A.P., Taisch, M., Vitali, S., (2014), Investigating Lean Methodology for Energy Efficient Manufacturing.

Ecological economists have questioned the desirability of labour productivity growth on both environmental and social grounds. In this paper we aim to contribute to ongoing debates by focusing on the link between labour productivity and worker wellbeing. First, we review the evidence for the happy-productive worker thesis, which suggests labour productivity could be improved by increasing worker wellbeing. Second, we review the evidence on ways that productivity growth may undermine worker wellbeing. We find there is experimental evidence demonstrating a causal effect of worker wellbeing on productivity, but that the relationship can also sometimes involve resource-intensive mediators. Taken together with the evidence of a negative impact on worker wellbeing from productivity growth, we conclude that a relentless pursuit of productivity growth is potentially counterproductive, not only in terms of worker wellbeing, but even in terms of long-term productivity. © 2021 The Author(s)","Health; Productivity; Productivity growth; Wellbeing; Workplace factors","ecological economics; experimental study; growth rate; labor policy; labor productivity; national economy; working conditions",,,,,"ES/S015124/1; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/M010163/1","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in particular through grant no: ES/M010163/1 which supports the Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity and ES/S015124/1 which supported the project “Powering Productivity”.",,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, M., Productivity: a history of its measurement (2018) History of Economic Thought and Policy, 2018 (1), pp. 57-79; Artz, B.M., Goodall, A.H., Oswald, A.J., Boss competence and worker well-being (2017) ILR Rev., 70 (2), pp. 419-450; Atkinson, T., Atkinson Review: Final Report.

As a result, the sustainability of software projects has become an important issue for members of those communities and their user bases. Building on the idea of forking as “an individual developer's behavior of copying an existing project's code base” and its signaling of active community involvement and participation, we ask the question: How does forking impact the sustainability of software development projects? Through the curation of digital trace data gathered from 749 software projects hosted on GitHub, we develop a longitudinal model to explain the contributions of various types of forking on software development project sustainability. Our findings contribute to research by moving beyond the conceptualization of forking as a monolithic concept and shows the benefits of certain types of forking for software projects' sustainability. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

Two color and two image backgrounds were compared with the default Google Android keyboard. Results revealed that keyboard background does not affect actual performance, however has a significant effect on perceived performance. Most participants felt that image backgrounds, regardless of whether they were pre or self-selected, affected their speed and accuracy. This suggests that it may be possible to enhance one’s text entry experience simply by designing an effective keyboard theme.

It is also one of the most expensive and labor-intensive products in human history. Software also has very poor quality that has caused many major disasters and wasted many millions of dollars. Software is also the target of frequent and increasingly serious cyber-attacks. Among the reasons for these software problems is a chronic lack of reliable quantified data. This reference provides quantified data from many countries and many industries based on about 26,000 projects developed using a variety of methodologies and team experience levels. The data has been gathered between 1970 and 2017, so interesting historical trends are available. Since current average software productivity and quality results are suboptimal, this book focuses on “best in class” results and shows not only quantified quality and productivity data from best-in-class organizations, but also the technology stacks used to achieve best-in-class results. The overall goal of this book is to encourage the adoption of best-in-class software metrics and best-in-class technology stacks. It does so by providing current data on average software schedules, effort, costs, and quality for several industries and countries. Because productivity and quality vary by technology and size, the book presents quantitative results for applications between 100 function points and 100,000 function points. It shows quality results using defect potential and DRE metrics because the number one cost driver for software is finding and fixing bugs. The book presents data on cost of quality for software projects and discusses technical debt, but that metric is not standardized. Finally, the book includes some data on three years of software maintenance and enhancements as well as some data on total cost of ownership. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Costs; Network security; Productivity; Software engineering; Defect potentials; Historical trends; Productivity data; Quantitative result; Software metrics; Software problems; Software productivity; Total cost of ownership; Program debugging",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abrain, A., (2008) Software Maintenance Management: Evolution and Continuous Improvement, , Wiley-IEEE Computer Society; Los Alamitos, CA; Abrain, A., (2010) Software Metrics and Metrology, , Wiley-IEEE Computer Society; Los Alamitos, CA; Abrain, A., (2015) Software Estimating Models, , Wiley-IEEE Computer Society; Los Alamitos, CA; Albrecht, A., (1984) AD/M Productivity Measurement and Estimate Validation, , IBM Corporation, Purchase, NY; Barrow, D., Nilson, S., Timberlake, D., (1993) Software Estimation Technology Report, , Air Force Software Technology Support Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT; Boehm, B., (1981) Software Engineering Economics, p. 900. , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Brooks, F., (1995) The Mythical Man-Month, p. 295. , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Brown, N., (1995) The Program Manager’s Guide to Software Acquisition Best Practices, p. 142. , Version 1.0; U.S. Department of Defense, Washington, DC; Bundschuh, M., Dekkers, C., (2008) The IT Measurement Compendium, p. 643. , Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany; Chidamber, S.R., Kemerer, C.F., A metrics suite for object oriented design (1994) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 20, pp. 476-493; Chidamber, S.R., Darcy, D.P., Kemerer, C.F., (1996) Managerial use of object oriented software metrics, p. 26. , Joseph M.

Using real-world scenarios and engaging everyday examples this book offers clear explanations of how the findings of cognitive psychologists have been put to use. The book explores all of the major areas of cognitive psychology, including attention, perception, memory, thinking and decision making, as well as some of the factors that affect cognitive processes, such as drugs and biological cycles. Now in full colour, this new edition has been thoroughly updated to include cutting-edge research and theories. There are also new chapters on perceptual errors and accidents, the influence of emotion, and the role of cognitive factors in music and sport. Written by well-respected experts in the field, this textbook will appeal to all undergraduate students of cognitive psychology, as well as professionals working in the areas covered in the book, such as education, police work, sport, and music. © 2016 David Groome, Michael W.

Higher education institutions are beginning to use analytics for improving the services they provide and for increasing student grades and retention. The U.S. Department of Education's National Education Technology Plan, as one part of its model for 21st-century learning powered by technology, envisions ways of using data from online learning systems to improve instruction. With analytics and data mining experiments in education starting to proliferate, sorting out fact from fiction and identifying research possibilitiesand practical applications are not easy. This issue brief is intended to help policymakers and administrators understand how analytics and data mining have been-and can be-applied for educational improvement. At present, educational data mining tends to focus on developing new tools for discovering patterns in data. These patterns are generally about the microconcepts involved in learning: one-digit multiplication, subtraction with carries, and so on. Learning analytics-at least as it is currently contrasted with data mining-focuses on applying tools and techniques at larger scales, such as in courses and at schools and postsecondary institutions. But both disciplines work with patterns and prediction: If we can discern the pattern in the data and make sense of what is happening, we can predict what should come next and take the appropriate action. Educational data mining and learning analytics are used to research and build models in several areas that can influence online learning systems. One area is user modeling, which encompasses what a learner knows, what a learner's behavior and motivation are, what the user experience is like, and how satisfied users are with online learning. At the simplest level, analytics can detect when a student in an online course is going astray and nudge him or her on to a course correction. At the most complex, they hold promise of detecting boredom from patterns of key clicks and redirecting the student's attention. Because these data are gathered in real time, there is a real possibility of continuous improvement via multiple feedback loops that operate at different time scales-immediate to the student for the next problem, daily to the teacher for the next day's teaching, monthly to the principal for judging progress, and annually to the district and state administrators for overall school improvement. The same kinds of data that inform user or learner models can be used to profile users. Profiling as used here means grouping similar users into categories using salient characteristics. These categories then can be used to offer experiences to groups of users or to make recommendations to the users and adaptations to how a system performs. User modeling and profiling are suggestive of real-time adaptations. In contrast, some applications of data mining and analytics are for more experimental purposes. Domain modeling is largely experimental with the goal of understanding how to present a topic and at what level of detail. The study of learning components and instructional principles also uses experimentation to understand what is effective at promoting learning. These examples suggest that the actions from data mining and analytics are always automatic, but that is less often the case. Visual data analyticsclosely involve humans to help make sense of data, from initial pattern detection and model building to sophisticated data dashboards that present data in a way that humans can act upon. K-12 schools and school districts are starting to adopt such institution-level analyses for detecting areas for instructional improvement, setting policies, and measuring results. Making visible students' learning and assessment activities opens up the possibility for students to develop skills in monitoring their own learning and to see directly how their effort improves their success. Teachers gain views into students' performance that help them adapt their teaching or initiate tutoring, tailored assignments, and the like. Robust applications of educational data mining and learning analytics techniques come with costs and challenges. Information technology (IT) departments will understand the costs associated with collecting and storing logged data, while algorithm developers will recognize the computational costs these techniques still require. Another technical challenge is that educational data systems are not interoperable, so bringing together administrative data and classroom-level data remains a challenge. Yet combining these data can give algorithms better predictive power. Combining data about student performance-online tracking, standardized tests, teachergenerated tests-to form one simplified picture of what a student knows can be difficult and must meet acceptable standards for validity. It also requires careful attention to student and teacher privacy and the ethical obligations associated with knowing and acting on student data. Educational data mining and learning analytics have the potential to make visible data that have heretofore gone unseen, unnoticed, and therefore unactionable. To help further the fields and gain value from their practical applications, the recommendations are that educators and administrators: • Develop a culture of using data for making instructional decisions. • Involve IT departments in planning for data collection and use. • Be smart data consumers who ask critical questions about commercial offerings and create demand for the most useful features and uses. • Start with focused areas where data will help, show success, and then expand to new areas. • Communicate with students and parents about where data come from and how the data are used. • Help align state policies with technical requirements for online learning systems.Researchers and software developers are encouraged to: • Conduct research on usability and effectiveness of data displays. • Help instructors be more effective in the classroom with more realtime and data-based decision support tools, including recommendation services. • Continue to research methods for using identified student information where it will help most, anonymizing data when required, and understanding how to align data across different systems. • Understand how to repurpose predictive models developed in one context to another. A final recommendation is to create and continue strong collaboration across research, commercial, and educational sectors. Commercial companies operate on fast development cycles and can produce data useful for research. Districts and schools want properly vetted learning environments. Effective partnerships can help these organizations codesign the best tools. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anaya, A.R., Boticario, J.G., A Data Mining Approach to Reveal Representative Collaboration Indicators in Open Collaboration Frameworks (2009) Educational Data Mining 2009: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Educational Data Mining, pp. 210-219. , edited by T.

This shift has meant that a much wider population of developers are faced with the task of developing parallel software: A difficult, time consuming and expensive process. With the aim of identifying issues, emerging practices and design opportunities for support, we present in this paper a qualitative study in which we interviewed a range of software developers, in both industry and academia. We then perform a systematic analysis of the data and identify several cross-cutting themes. These analysis themes include the practical relevance of the probe effect, the significance of orchestration models in development and the mismatch between currently available tools and developers' needs. We also identify an important characteristic of parallel programming, where the process of optimisation goes hand in hand with the process of debugging, as opposed to clearer distinctions which may be made in traditional programming. We conclude with reflection on how the study can inform the design of software tools to support developers in the endeavour of parallel programming.","Many-core; Multi-core; Parallel programming; Qualitative study; Visualisation","Human engineering; Parallel programming; Tools; Visualization; Design considerations; Design of softwares; Many-core; Multi core; Parallel performance tools; Qualitative study; Single-core processors; Systematic analysis; Parallel processing systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ball, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., Structured and opportunistic processing in design: A critical discussion (1995) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies; Bonar, J., Liffick, B., A visual programming language for novices (1987) Technical Report; Bonar, J., Soloway, E., Preprogramming knowledge: A major source of misconceptions in novice programmers (1985) Human-Computer Interaction, 1 (2), pp. 133-161; Boulay, B.D., O'Shea, T., Monk, J., The black box inside the glass box: Presenting computing concepts to novices (1999) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 51 (2), pp. 265-277; Cantrill, B., Shapiro, M.W., Leventhal, A.H., Dynamic instrumentation of production systems (2004) USENIX Annual Technical Conference; Casavant, T., (1993) Tools and Methods for Visualization of Parallel Systems and Computations Guest Editors Introduction, , June; Gould, J., Drongowski, P., An exploratory study of computer program debugging (1974) Human Factors, 16, pp. 258-277; Eccles, R., Stacey, D., Understanding the parallel programmer (2006) 20th International Symposium on High-Performance Computing, pp. 12-12; Fix, V., Wiedenbeck, S., Scholtz, J., Mental representations of programs by novices and experts (1993) Proc.

It is particularly important in the design of an effective quality management system. The assessment is often considered from the perspective of fulfilling customers' requirements; however, the level of compatibility between a product or service providers' perceptions of what to deliver and the customers' desires or expectations is often uncertain. This paper describes an empirical study evaluating, within the software industry in Egypt, the extent to which differences, or 'gaps', may exist between software provider perceptions and customer expectations regarding the levels of ideal and actual degrees of performance within multiple dimensions of quality. The study involved a survey of 142 software developers and 111 software customers where gaps were found to exist across nine measured dimensions of quality. These gaps were found to be both statistically and practically significant. The existence of such quality performance gaps is often not measured. These gaps, however, must be firstly measured, and recognised, and secondly addressed within an organisation otherwise there will exist 'flaws' within the design and implementation of the organisation's quality management programme. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Perceptions and expectations gaps; Quality management; Quality performance; Quality performance gaps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdul-Rashid, A.-A., Normah, A., Outsourcing and quality performance: Malaysia's public works department (2004) Structural Survey, 22 (1), pp. 53-60; Adam, E.E., Corbett, L.M., Flores, B.E., Harrison, N.J., Lee, T.S., Rho, B.-H., Ribera, J., Westbrook, R., An international study of quality improvement approach and firm performance (1997) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 17 (9), pp. 842-873; Agus, A., The structural linkages between TQM, product quality performance, and business performance: Preliminary empirical study in electronics companies (2005) Singapore Management Review, 27 (1), p. 87; Alexander, K.R., Don, D., Claudio, F.L., Cesar, G.V., How can we achieve and maintain high-quality performance of health workers in low-resource settings?

With the increasing emoji use in software development-related communication, it has become important to understand why software developers are using emojis and their impact. Objective: Gaining a deeper understanding is essential because the intention of emoji usage might be affected by the demographics and experience of developers; also, frequency and the distribution of emoji usage might change depending on the activity, stage of the development, and nature of the conversation, etc. Methods: We present a large-scale empirical study on the intention of emoji usage conducted on 2,712 Open Source Software (OSS) projects. We build a machine learning model to automate classifying the intentions behind emoji usage in 39,980 posts. We also surveyed 60 open-source software developers from 17 countries to understand developers’ perceptions of why and when emojis are used. Results: Our results show that we can classify the intention of emoji usage with high accuracy (AUC of 0.97). In addition, the results indicate that developers use emoji for varying intentions, and emoji usage intention changes throughout a conversation. Conclusion: Our study opens a new avenue in Software Engineering research related to automatically identifying the intention of the emoji use that can help improve the communication efficiency and help project maintainers monitor and ensure the quality of communication. Another thread of future research could look into what intentions of emoji usage or what kind of emojis are more likely to attract users and how that is associated with emoji usage diffusion in different levels (threads, projects, etc.) © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Emoji; Empirical analysis; Sentiment analysis; Software engineering","Behavioral research; Open source software; Open systems; Software design; Emoji; Empirical analysis; Empirical studies; High-accuracy; Large-scales; Machine learning models; Open source software projects; Sentiment analysis; Social media platforms; Software developer; Sentiment analysis",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 465614/2014-0; Fundação de Amparo à Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco, FACEPE: APQ-0399-1.03/17; Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia para Engenharia de Software, INES","We thank the anonymous reviews for their thoughtful comments and suggestions.

Software portability is important for the software developers as many software projects have a lifetime longer than a specific system, e.g., a supercomputer, and it is important for the domain scientists that realize their scientific application in a software framework and want to be able to run on one or another system. On a high level, there exist two approaches for realizing platform portability: (1) implementing software using a portability layer leveraging any technique which always generates specific kernels from another language or through an interface for running on different architectures; and (2) providing backends for different hardware architectures, with the backends typically differing in how and in which programming language functionality is realized due to using the language of choice for each hardware (e.g., CUDA kernels for NVIDIA GPUs, SYCL (DPC++) kernels to targeting Intel GPUs and other supported hardware, …). In practice, these two approaches can be combined in applications to leverage their respective strengths. In this paper, we present how we realize portability across different hardware architectures for the Ginkgo library by following the second strategy and the goal to not only port to new hardware architectures but also achieve good performance. We present the Ginkgo library design, separating algorithms from hardware-specific kernels forming the distinct hardware executors, and report our experience when adding execution backends for NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPUs. We also present the performance we achieve with this approach for distinct hardware backends. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AMD; Intel; NVIDIA; Performance portability; Platform Portability; Porting to GPU accelerators","Application programs; Computer hardware; Computer software portability; Graphics processing unit; High level languages; Supercomputers; AMD; GPU accelerators; Hardware architecture; Intel; Math library; NVIDIA; Performance; Performance portability; Platform portability; Porting to GPU accelerator; Program processors",,,,,"Office of Science, SC; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Ministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-Württemberg, MWK","This work was supported by the US Exascale Computing Project ( 17-SC-20-SC ), a collaborative effort of the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration, United States .

In general, those tools are developed with a focus on technical aspects not taking into account important usability principles. On the other hand, the Human–Computer Interaction community presents great potential for the improvement of interfaces in network management tools suggesting that usability guidelines can guide software developers during user interface design. The goal of this work is to evaluate how different usability design guidelines can assist software developers in elaborating network monitoring tools interfaces with improved usability, creating a better experience for network administrators. To do that, we engage in an experimental study, where 52 software developers prototyped user interfaces based on different scenarios and applied 12 guidelines for usability design in network monitoring tools. Through the quantitative and qualitative analysis as well as Fisher's Exact Test, we demonstrate that the level of complexity of the scenarios for the creation of the prototypes had no significant effect on the acceptance of the guidelines. We conclude that the guidelines were used by most participants and are relevant to assist the software developers to create interfaces with a focus on usability in network monitoring tools. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Design guidelines; Graphical user interface; Network management; Network-monitoring tools; Usability; User-centered design","Acceptance tests; Human computer interaction; Monitoring; Network management; Software design; Usability engineering; Design guideline; In networks; In-network management; Network administrator; Network monitoring tools; Networks management; Software developer; Technical aspects; Tool interface; Usability design; Graphical user interfaces",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 144477/2018-1, 313312/2019-2, 432064/2018-4; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia, FAPESB: TIC0004/2015","This work was partly supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazil under grants 313312/2019-2 , 144477/2018-1 and 432064/2018-4 ; and FAPESB, Brazil under grant TIC0004/2015 .",,,,,,,,,,"Bajpai, V., Schönwälder, J., A survey on internet performance measurement platforms and related standardization efforts (2015) IEEE Commun.

A practical analysis utilizing the academic performance data to improve the quality of online learning has become a vital issue urgently required to guide HEIs for the improvement of the academic performance of students. The changes affected in the Covid-19 framework have affected the academic performance of students and educators. This study aims to summarize the various aspects of educational data mining and how it can be utilized to improve the teaching process. Using EDM, the study analyzed students' academic performance for the past five years. It focused on the various learning methods that the students used. The study provided a detailed analysis of the multiple attributes that influenced the students' academic performance. We presented 12 out of 56 papers/documents that fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria of students' academic performance based on the educational setting. This study revealed that the most commonly used methods for assessing students' academic performance are not done in the face-to-face learning method. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.","Academic Performance; Attributes; Data Mining Techniques; Learning Methods; Variables",,,,,,"Universiti Teknologi Petronas, UTP; Yayasan UTP, YUTP: 015LC0-298","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Higher Education and the Computer & Information Science Department, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP), for providing the facilities and the financial support to conduct this study.

They are supported by peripheral developers, who contribute either via discussions or programming tasks, often for a limited time. It is unclear what role these peripheral developers play in the programming and communication efforts, as well as the temporary task-related sub-groups in the projects. We mine code-repository data and mailing-list discussions to model the relationships and contributions of developers in a social network and devise a method to analyze the temporal collaboration structures in communication and programming, learning about the strength and stability of social sub-groups in open-source software projects. Our method uses multi-modal social networks on a series of time windows. Previous work has reduced the network structure representing developer collaboration to networks with only one type of interaction, which impedes the simultaneous analysis of more than one type of interaction. We use both communication and version-control data of open-source software projects and model different types of interaction over time. To demonstrate the practicability of our measurement and analysis method, we investigate 10 substantial and popular open-source software projects and show that, if sub-groups evolve, modeling these sub-groups helps predict the future evolution of interaction levels of programmers and groups of developers. Our method allows maintainers and other stakeholders of open-source software projects to assess instabilities and organizational changes in developer interaction and can be applied to different use cases in organizational analysis, such as understanding the dynamics of a specific incident or discussion. © 2021 by the owner/author(s).","Coordination; group structures; open-source software; repository mining; tensor decomposition","Open systems; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Software design; Tensors; Coordination; Group dynamics; Group structure; Model groups; Open source software projects; Open-source software development; Programming tasks; Repository mining; Sub-groups; Tensor decomposition; Open source software",,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: AP 206/14-1, AP 206/5-1&2, AP 206/6-1&2","This work was supported by the DFG (German Research Foundation, AP 206/5-1&2, AP 206/6-1&2, and AP 206/14-1) as well as the Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science, and the Arts in the framework of the Center Digitisation.Bavaria (ZD.B).

As knowledge-based firms, COSS companies' success depends heavily on the interplay among intangible resources such as human capital, relational capital, structural capital, and software quality. To observe these relationships, we conducted a hypothesis-testing questionnaire-type survey involving 200 software development experts and professionals working at 60 multinational COSS companies. Accordingly, the study unearthed two different but conjoint ways (i.e., direct and indirect) in which intellectual capital impacts COSS company's success. On the one hand, relational capital one of the intellectual capital components directly affects COSS company's success. On the other hand, relational and structural capital indirectly affect COSS company success through human capital, which, in turn, is itself mediated by software quality in a sequential mediation model. Therefore, COSS companies may need to prioritize software quality as it is the most critical variable impacting the success of COSS companies. © 2013 IEEE.","Commercial open-source software; company success; intellectual capital; software quality","Computer software selection and evaluation; Integrated circuits; Knowledge based systems; Open source software; Open systems; Software design; Software testing; Surveys; Timing circuits; Commercial open-source software; Company success; Human capitals; Intellectual capital; Knowledge-based systems; Open-source softwares; Relational capital; Software; Software Quality; Source software companies; Knowledge management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abd-Elrahma, A.-E.H., El-Borsaly, A.A.-E., Hafez, E.A.-E., Hassan, S.A., Intellectual capital and service quality within the mobile telecommunications sector of Egypt (2020) J.

In general, research is an essential field for any public and private educational institutions. Research also provides a significant impact to increase the country's productivity, thus boosting its reputation globally. The main issue is how research grants funded by government can provide returns towards academicians, society, and the country. Thus, the objectives of this study was to identify indicators to measure impact of the university research grant. The systematic review of the literature method was conducted using two main journal indexed databases: Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. From the analysis, the results showed that four themes and 24 sub-themes were connected to the research impact. The four themes were scholarly production impact (10 sub-themes), research advancement impact (8 sub-themes), policy implication (3 sub-themes), and health and economic impact (3 sub-themes), which were discussed in the results. In conclusion, investment in research is important to help various parties gain benefits as listed in the research advancement impact theme of this study. © 2021 Little Lion Scientific.","Impact; Outcome; Output; Systematic literature review; University grant",,,,,,"Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, UMT: SRG55194","This work was supported by Universiti Malaysia Terengganu under Strategic Research Grant Scheme (SRG55194).

In this paper, we present the results of a controlled 11-week longitudinal study with 57 CS1 students comparing two skill-based interventions to improve programming performance. The first intervention involves spatial training, an established baseline known to be helpful in engineering contexts. The second intervention is a novel CS-focused technical reading training. In our reading training, we teach strategies for summarizing scientific papers and understanding scientific charts and figures; most of the covered readings were CS1-accessible portions of computer science research papers. For the spatial training, we use a standardized training curriculum previously found to improve programming skills by focusing on spatial ability (i.e., the ability to mentally manipulate objects). We first replicate findings that both reading ability and spatial ability correlate with programming success. Significantly, however, we find that those in our reading training exhibit larger programming ability gains than those in the standard spatial training (p = 0.02, f2=0.10). We also find that reading trained participants perform particularly well on programming problems that require tracing through code (p = 0.03, f2=0.10). Our results suggest that technical reading training could be beneficial for novice programmers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for future CS1 interventions, the possibility for non-programming based training to positively impact developers, and future directions for software engineering education research. © 2021 ACM.","CS1; Spatial Ability; Technical Reading; Transfer Training","Engineering education; Software engineering; Critical component; Novice programmer; Novice programming; Programming ability; Skill training; Spatial abilities; Spatial skills; Technical reading; Training skills; Transfer training; Students",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: CCF 1763674, CCF 1908633","We acknowledge the partial support of the NSF (CCF 1908633, CCF 1763674) as well as both the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching and the Center for Academic Innovation at the University of Michigan.

Measures are useful indicators to evaluate processes, projects, products, and people who are part of software development teams. The results of these measurements are used to make decisions, manage projects, and improve software development and project management processes. This research is based on selecting a set of measures related to social and human factors (SHF) that influence productivity in software development teams and therefore in project management. This research was performed in three steps. In the first step, there was performed a tertiary literature review aimed to identify measures related to productivity. Then, the identified measures were submitted for its evaluation to project management experts and finally, the measures selected by the experts were mapped to the SHF. A set of 13 measures was identified and defined as a key input for designing improvement strategies. The measures have been compared to SHF to evaluate the development team's performance from a more human context and to establish indicators in productivity improvement strategies of software projects. Although the number of productivity measures related to SHF is limited, it was possible to identify the measures used in both traditional and agile contexts. © 2021, SciKA.","Human and social factors; Productivity measures; Software development productivity; Software project management",,,,,,"Universidad de Guadalajara, UDG; Universidad del Valle, Univalle; Universidad de Medellín, UdeM","We thank the two experts of organizational productivity who participated in the evaluation of each of the measures identified in this research.

Lean and agile are critical strategies because the former ensures efficient use of resources while the latter involves matching supply with demand in turbulent/unpredictable markets. Careful adoption of both strategies will lead to SC performance improvement. This paper aims at advancing their understanding by conducting an intensive scientific literature review to unravel the state of art of lean-agile SC by examining the procedure of knowledge conceiving, transmission, and development from a dynamic viewpoint. To achieve this, a dynamic cum quantitative review technique named ‘systematic literature network analysis (SLNA)’ is applied. The investigation enabled unravelling research directions/emerging themes in the lean-agile field thereby supporting researchers/newcomers to target specific themes to explore.

Developers perform refactoring activities based on the result of such detection tools to improve source code quality. However, such an approach can be considered as reactive refactoring, i.e., developers react to code smells after they occur. This means that developers first suffer the effects of low-quality source code before they start solving code smells. In this study, we focus on proactive refactoring, i.e., refactoring source code before it becomes smelly. This approach would allow developers to maintain source code quality without having to suffer the impact of code smells. To support the proactive refactoring process, we propose a technique to detect decaying modules, which are non-smelly modules that are about to become smelly. We present empirical studies on open source projects with the aim of studying the characteristics of decaying modules. Additionally, to facilitate developers in the refactoring planning process, we perform a study on using a machine learning technique to predict decaying modules and report a factor that contributes most to the performance of the model under consideration. © 2021 The Institute of Electronics.","Code quality; Code smells; Refactoring","Learning systems; Odors; Open source software; Activity-based; Code quality; Code smell; Detection tools; Exploratory studies; Refactorings; Source code metrics; Source code qualities; Source codes; Static analyzers; Computer programming languages",,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: JP18K11238, JP21H04877","This work was partly supported by JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research Numbers JP18K11238 and JP21H04877.",,,,,,,,,,"Sae-Lim, N., Hayashi, S., Saeki, M., Toward proactive refactoring: An exploratory study on decaying modules (2019) Proc. third International Workshop on Refactoring (IWOR'19), pp. 1-10; Sae-Lim, N., Hayashi, S., Saeki, andM., Can automated impact analysis techniques help predict decaying modules?

Inspiration for the development of the conceptual model is obtained from previous literature and focus-group-discussions. The model is validated with the help of the data obtained from two co-located software modules. A set of team-composition scenarios for different team knowledge-processing-abilities and team-seniority ratios are used to evaluate and compare the effect of the proposed model on a co-located team performance. The performance is measured in terms of total costs, extent of faulty-work and rework cost. It has been found that teams comprising of medium level of experience and medium-to-high knowledge-processing-ability provide good compromising solutions with lower total costs, less faulty-work and less cost of rework. The proposed model may act as a decision-support tool to the co-located software project managers during team composition in order to improve performance. © Operational Research Society 2021.","co-located software project (CSP); Knowledge growth; model development; software project performance; team composition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akgün, A.E., Team wisdom in software development projects and its impact on project performance (2020) International Journal of Information Management, 50, pp. 228-242. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.05.019; Bahargam, S., Golshan, B., Lappas, T., Terzi, E., A team-formation algorithm for faultline minimization (2019) Expert Systems with Applications, 119, pp. 441-455. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2018.10.046; Balle, A.R., Oliveira, M., Curado, C., Nodari, F., How do knowledge cycles happen in software development methodologies?

To remedy that gap, this paper presented an online experiment to measure the productivity of software programmers, as a representative of knowledge workers, in a particular situation when a more aligned with the work process IT system is used. The assumed research model was based on the systems approach of complementarity theory and combined the following factors: worker’s cognitive style, work process, decision-making authority, worker training mode, and worker incentive. The experiment was conducted for 4 months and attracted 110 participants with innovative cognitive style from two crowdsourcing platforms. The results demonstrate that complementarities condition the productivity of a knowledge worker. More specifically, the learning effect is crucial for productivity gains and should be considered in further detail in the design of new studies. The paper’s key contribution is the test of a unique configuration of two systems of complementary factors, because most of the literature has investigated only the impact of particular factors in isolation. © 2020, University of Economics and Human Sciences in Warsaw.

It allows more productivity of computer programming as it aims to provide automation of transformation of models into actual source code. This process has been covered adequately in many programming languages. However, this topic has not been covered sufficiently with regards to Fourth Generation Languages (4GL) which have a high specialized nature. The goal of this paper is to represent a systematic literature review of 4GL Code generation. The paper focuses on reviewing systemically the studies published in the past 20 years on the topic. This is to investigate the trends in the topic and the approaches introduced in order to identify potential new research lines. © Science and Information Organization.","4GL; Code generation; Code transformation; Extraction transform load (ETL); Model driven development (MDD); Model driven engineering (MDE); Rapid application development (RAD); Software engineering","Application programs; Automatic programming; Codes (symbols); 4GL; Code transformation; Codegeneration; Extraction transform load; Model driven development; Model driven engineering; Model-driven Engineering; Model-driven-development; Rapid application development; Cosine transforms",,,,,"Umm Al-Qura University, UQU","I would like to express my gratitude to my University (Umm Al Qura University) which gave me the opportunity to do this research.

This research paper presents the performance measure of different tools in the project planning and management phase of software development. Diverse tools exist for each and every phase of the development and depending on the outcome of the evaluation or selection criteria, tool with highest score is being chosen. This paper measures the performance of alternative project management tools viz. Jira, Trello, Leankit, AgileCraft based on these evaluation or selection criteria. To execute the underlying research work, a six-point scaling table is defined. The table measures the performance of project management automation tools and realizing their competence level score. This performance measure or the outcome as competence level score will be useful for the researchers or software developers to contemplate the best project management automation tool typically before making a decision about tool selection. © BEIESP.","Automation; Automation Tools; DevOps; Project Management; Project Planning; Software development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gill, A.Q., Loumish, A., Riyat, I., Han, S., DevOps for Information Management Systems (2018) Vine Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems, , ISSN: 2059-5891, February; de Bayser, M., Azevedo, L.G., Cerqueira, R., Research Ops: The Case for DevOps in Scientific Applications IBM Research; Andreou, A., Christoforou, A., Baresi, L., Papazoglou, M., Tamburri, D., DOSSIER-Cloud DEVOPS-BASED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING FOR THE CLOUD (2019) Deliverable D4.5 Survey Paper / Technical Report on Devops Automation and Software Service Composition, , February; Rybing, T., The Volcano – Prioritize Work for Multiple Teams & Products, , https://www.infoq.com/articles/volcano-prioritize-work/, 2016, May 21, Online; Meena, S., (2014) Devops & Configuration Management Tools (Slide-39/45), , https://www.slideshare.net/sahilsk/configuration-management-stackexpress-20140610, July 16; https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/184346/dependency-visualisation-javascript-library-compatible-with-locker-service; Risk Management for an Agile World, , https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1213146/riskregister?hosting=cloud&tab=overview; Oracle FAQ’s, , http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/Oracle_11gR2, Oracle 11gR2; Kiss, T., E2E Python Solutions in DevOps – Part 4 (2019) IT Blog for Sharing.

This is because there are practical benefits for universities focused on developing knowledge. This study depends on brainstorming, focus group, and individual interviews as the main tools for data collection. The sample consisted of 23 individuals (six participants for brainstorming, 11 in the focus group session, and six individual interviews). Three key themes and seven sub-themes of knowledge management were explored: 1) knowledge creation (combination, socialisation, internalisation, and externalisation); 2) knowledge transfer (personalisation knowledge transfer and codification knowledge transfer); 3) knowledge sharing (sharing information). The proposed model is severely designed and comprehensively conceptualised utilising innovative, informational, and technological concepts underlining knowledge management within Australian higher education. However, there is a need to assess a designed measurement by considering existing quantitative techniques for the development of scales, such as validity and reliability analysis. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Brainstorming;

Research on social systems has primarily focused on observable behaviors in ISD, however, little attention has been paid to cognitive aspects. We draw on emotional intelligence as an important dimension of cognition and seek to develop theoretical understanding of the mechanisms for managing emotions in agile ISD. To achieve this objective, we conducted a qualitative study of agile ISD teams in two organizations. This research-in-progress presents initial results on the concept of emotional intelligence and its effects in agile ISD. Our research contributes to the literature first by providing a deeper conceptualization of emotional intelligence in agile ISD. Second, it theoretically and empirically demonstrates work outcomes of emotional intelligence. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.","Agile information system development; Emotional intelligence; Socio-technical system","Cognitive systems; Emotional intelligence; Information systems; Information use; Management information systems; Agile information system; Cognitive aspects; Customer requirements; Observable behavior; Qualitative study; Social systems; Sociotechnical systems; Technical systems; Agile manufacturing systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aladwani, A.M., An empirical examination of the role of social integration in system development projects (2002) Information Systems Journal, 12 (4), pp. 339-353; Ang, S., Slaughter, S.A., Work outcomes and job design for contract versus permanent information systems professionals on software development teams (2001) MISQ, 25 (3), pp. 321-350; Balijepally, V., Mahapatra, R., Nerur, S., Price, K.H., Are two heads better than one for software development?

The aim of the study was to evaluate possibilities for establishing tool support for tracking software developers' working time. The organization wants to improve their project management and effort estimation processes and they need a lightweight, tool-based approach for collecting and reporting the working time data. We propose a categorization for different types of time tracking tools and perform an evaluation of tools from different categories. Requirements for the tools and evaluation criteria are derived both from literature and the case company. DESMET method is utilized to rank the tools.",,"Effort Estimation; Evaluation criteria; Finnish; Software developer; Software development organizations; Time tracking; Tool support; Working time; Knowledge engineering; Project management; Tools; Software engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atkins, D., Ball, T., Graves, T., Mockus, A., Using version control data to evaluate the impact of software tools: A case study of the version editor (2002) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 28 (7), pp. 625-637; Boehm, B., Clark, B., Horowitz, E., Westland, C., Madachy, R., Selby, R., Cost models for future software lifecycles: Cocomo 2.0 (1995) Annals of Software Engineering, 1, pp. 57-94; Faulk, S., Gustafson, J., Johnson, P., Porter, A., Tichy, W., Votta, L., Measuring hpc productivity (2004) International Journal of High Performance Computing, 18 (4); Fenton, N., Neil, M., Software metrics: Roadmap (2000) Proceedings of the ICSE - Future of Software Engineering Track, pp. 357-370; Humphrey, W.S., (1997) Introduction to the Personal Software Process, , Addison-Wesley: Reading, MA; Johnson, P.M., Moore, C., Dane, J.A., Brewer, R.S., Empirically guided software effort guesstimation (2000) IEEE Software, 17 (6), pp. 51-56; Johnson, P., Project hackystat: Accelerating adoption of empirically guided system development through nondisruptive, developer-centric (2001) Process Data Collection and Analysis, , Univ. of Hawaii, technical report; Johnson, P., You can't even ask them to push a button: Toward ubiquitous, developer-centric, empirical software engineering (2001) The NSF Workshop for New Visions for Software Design and Productivity: Research and Applications, , Nashville, TN; Johnson, P., Supporting development of highly dependable system through continuous, automated, inprocess, and individualized system measurement validation (2002) University of Hawaii, Technical Report; Johnson, P., Ultra-automation and ultra-autonomy for software engineering management of ultra-large-scale systems (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 Workshop on Ultra Large Scale Systems, , Minneapolis, Minnesota; Jorgensen, M., A review of studies on expert estimation of software development effort (2004) Journal of Systems and Software, 70 (1-2), pp. 37-60; Kitchenham, B., Desmet: A method for evaluating software engineering methods and tools (1996) Technical Report TR96-09, , Dept. of Computer Science, University of Keele, U.K; Mockus, A., Votta, L.G., Identifying reasons for software change using historic databases (2000) Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Maintenance, pp. 120-130; Mockus, A., Weiss, D.M., Zhang, P., Understanding and predicting effort in software projects (2003) Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 274-284; Molich, R., Nielsen, J., Improving a human-computer dialogue (1990) Communications of the ACM, 33 (3), pp. 338-348; Nielsen, J., Molich, R., Heuristic evaluation of user interfaces (1990) Proc.
